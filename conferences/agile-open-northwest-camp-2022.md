# Agile Open Northwest Camp 2022

* 2 day sprints to reorganize priorities
  * Constantly listening to feedback from the market and reprioritizing what the most valuable work is that should be done first.

* Some companies use commit message to reflect the type of work and the risk of the work being done. A refactor should hopefully have a risk score of 0 whereas a new feature might have a risk fater of `3` (whatever the organization designates that to mean).

* Evolutionary Design + Iterative Development
  * Feedback loop - only listen to signals that are real, not imagency. Program for the signals you see today not the ways you may see in 10 years.
  * Diversify ideas when at a crossroads. Spit into small groups for 1 hour to parellelize discvoery and experiment with differnt approaches.
  * Sunk cost falacy is exacerbated with deadlines. So ineffective ways of working continue to impede flow (e.g. building on top of technical debt, using ineffective working agreements, etc.) because a short-term slowdown may mean not meeting the short-term deadline.
  * Experiment on and with everything; always continue to iterate.
  * Need psychological saftey and maturity to cut costs and reduce wasted effort Maturity lets people recognize that what they are doing currently isn't working. Whereas psychological saftey lets people experiment and fail.

* mob models
  1. Everyone knows
      * Learn new things
  2. ...
  3. ...
  4. ...
  5. ...

* Heate / Love Scrum
  * Little value in cemeronies
  * Publish shaming is a common form of guilting people into join ceremonies.

* Software development philosophy
  * Functional, Clean, or Tested - Pick 2
  * Functional: What the customer wants (customer value)
  * Clean: Make it easy to read and change
  * More rules does not mean cleaner code.
  * Linters are another dependency in the system
  * Cultural guidelines are stronger to writing clean code over hard rules
  * Bad code is long, confuding, and inconsistent
  * Clean code is short with a clear intent (making it self documenting). It is also consistent in respects to file and folder conventions. Lastly, it does not include anything that does not make the intent more clear.
  * Testing takes a lot of time to learn and develop that skil in a meaningful way. Tests usually test the wrong thing (e.g. mocks).
  * Only test how it will be used by a user
  * Only inputs and outputs, not implementations: even if that feels like you are just testing the underlying library because that is your interface's contract.
  * "What is the opportunity (not problem) we are trying to solve for?" - Ron Q.
    * Recommended read: Continuous Discovery Habits
  * Goal -> Opportunity -> Solution

* Evolutionary design
  * Short expeirments
  * Thin slices - LEAN
  * Empower teams
  * Fail (fast) to learn
  * Be intentional with learning
  * Embrace chaos versus (trying) to control choas.
    * Choas does not mean disorder.
  * Small, frequent dopamine its keep us motivated. Frequent little wins versus infrequeng big wings. This means release fast.
  * Engineers create product realitites.
  * Engineers are people pleasers.
  * Product owners should use langauge like "I would like ..." instead of "I want.." when working our product details. The first is aspirational whereas the second is a command. This helps find solutions outside of the box because the box is never defined.
  * Estimates are guesses informed by experience in things being developed in the context in which it is being worked in.
  * Build in quality from the start to avoid longterm stagnation in which technical debt impedes flows to the point that only fires are being worked on. Plan for the marathon.
  * Technical debt is a buisness decision prevented by ruthless refactoring.
  * Technical debt is a fact of nature.
  * Remove techincal debt when needed.
  * A good analgy for technical debt is that you can cook dinner in a pot today but at some point you will have to then clean before you can cook dinner again. - Wyatt C.
  * Trust engineres to do what is right at the rigth moment.

* DOJO Academy
  * products are build through in-real-time cross dispiplinary collaboration, like a band.
  * Most scrum events are worthless - conversations are the most important element.
  * People who want to work together make a team / band successful, not people who are forced to work together.
  * End-to-end teams are an ensamble
  * Teach and level up everybody by slowing down (e.g. paired / mob programming)
  * When driving a card, slowing down to make a turn is the safest way to change directions.
  * People learn in loops, how long those loops are depend on the individual.
  * DOJO Method:
    1. Frame challenge / opportunity
    2. Plan
    3. Do
    4. Share (30 minutes)
    5. Reflect (30 minutes)
    * 2 day cycles:
      * Monday: Frame + Plan + Do
      * Tuesday: Do + Share + Reflect
      * Wednesday: Frame + Plan + Do
      * Thursday: Do + Share + Reflect
      * Friday: Free / Contionus learning
  * Do mobbing with product owners, designers, etc. when needed: it is only a 2-day committment to crank out all that work.
  * Make decisions about socpe, issues, etc. every 2 days. This makes it very easy to pivot as assumptions are challanged and the scope of work is discovered.
  * Be intentional with what you want to learn from each iteration.

* Cross displinary mobbing
  * Happens all the time outside of programming
    * Surgery teams
    * NASA
    * Music
    * Ships
  * Most team efforts are cross disiplinary out of the box and have one shared missin / objective.
  * Cross dispinary coding works well with "export" mode (from differnt  types of mobbing from another talk)
  * Mobbing reduces hand-off costs to 0. Code reviews, design discussions, brain storming solutions, etc. all happen in real time.
  * All decisions have diverse perspective and know by all as tribial knowledge.
  * Some teams employ static meeting location / URL in which anybody can join from inside the team or across the organization
    * Akin to office hours: easy to find the people you want to talk to for a second
  * "Everybody I need to deliver this is in the room" - ?
    * All focus on the most important or valuable problem to solve
  * All authors of the Agile Manifesto have their own unique implementation of Agile, all rooted in Extreme Programming

* TEAL
  * Ron Quartel (FAST Agile)
  * Open Space is scalled Extreme Programming
  * You need local psychological saftey to expeirment, learn, fail, etc.
  * Dynamic reteaming around the work to be done
  * Self-organizing is not for everybody
    * Individual recognitision is sparse / non-existant
  * Can't control chaos, but can create structure to handle chaotic events
  * Dependencies between people manage themselves through conversations. No need for a controller (e.g. manager) to facilitate those conversations.
  * Shared understanding of opportunity the busines is trying to realized / capture is critical. This requires transparency, otherwise, buy in is difficult.
    * When organizations lack buy in, authority is used to make up the difference.
  * Cliques work for delivery, but not innovation. Break up cliques to generate new ideas.
    * Facilitated by structures (e.g. innovation days)
  * People work better with meaning and purpose in their lives

* Book: 9 Rules to Debugging

* Turning Agile Woo Woo into Action
  * Waterfall: I know what I don't like once it is done. Meaning there is a lot of wated effort on things I do not want.
  * Agile: Iterative feedback throughout to avoid wasted effort.
  * Book: XP Explained
  * Mobbing reduces hand off costs such as conversations around design, architecture, and trade offs. All members are aligned and have a shared understanding
  * Mobbing forces reconciliation, so if there is ever uncertainty the mob reaches out for clarity. This is a step-by-step process: constant feedback from peers in mob.
    * How to architect feature
    * Clarify business requiement
  * Introduce changes as experiments during retrospectives.
    * Keep experiments small, not sweaping.
    * Have to get buy in from the team, can't force it.
  * Agile Litmus Test: "When was the last time you changed something because of your Retrospective?" - ?
  * How an organization runs during a crisis is how it truely runs. During a crisis, people cut the fluff to be as efficient as possible.

* What is Product Ownership?
  * Constantly advocting for Customer Value to drive Business Value

* Agile Leader Community of Practice
  * Servant leadership
  * Transparency
  * No formal leader
  * Trust
  * Safe space / psychologyal saftey
  * Design effective working environments
  * Quality of Information
  * Executive coaching does not usually solve systemic cultural issues
