# Agile Open Northwest Camp 2022

* 2 day sprints to reorganize priorities
  * Constantly listening to feedback from the market and reprioritizing what the most valuable work is that should be done first.

* Some companies use commit message to reflect the type of and the risk of work being done.
  * A refactor should hopefully have a risk score of 0 whereas a new feature might have a risk fater of `3` (whatever the organization designates that to mean).

* Evolutionary Design + Iterative Development
  * Feedback loop - only listen to signals that are real, not imaginary. Program for the signals you see today not the ones you may see in 10 years.
  * Diversify ideas when at a crossroads. Spit into small groups for 1 hour to parellelize discovery and experiment with differnt approaches.
  * Sunk cost falacy is exacerbated with deadlines. So ineffective ways of working continue to impede flow (e.g. building on top of technical debt, using ineffective working agreements, etc.) because a short-term slowdown may mean not meeting the deadline.
  * Experiment on and with everything; always continue to iterate.
  * Need psychological saftey and maturity to cut costs and reduce wasted effort.
    * Maturity lets people recognize that what they are doing currently isn't working.
    * Whereas psychological saftey lets people experiment and fail.

* Types of Mob Models
  1. Everyone knows - learn new things from others (e.g. hotkeys)
  2. One persons knows - share knowledge with peers
  3. No body knows - learn new things together
  4. Two people know - ?
  5. ? - ?

* Hate and Love Scrum
  * Little value in cemeronies - main value is to spark conversations (e.g. I am blocked with ...).
  * Public shaming is a common form of guilting people into joining ceremonies.

* Software development philosophy
  * Functional, Clean, or Tested - Pick 2
    * Functional: What the customer wants (customer value) - almost always has to be selected
    * Clean: Make it easy to read and change
    * Tested: Tested
  * More rules does not mean cleaner code.
    * Linters are another dependency in the system
    * Cultural guidelines are stronger to writing clean code over hard rules
  * Bad code is long, confusing, and inconsistent. Clean code is short with a clear intent (making it self documenting). It is also consistent in respects to file and folder conventions. Lastly, it does not include anything that does not make the intent more clear.
  * Testing takes a lot of time to learn and develop that skil in a meaningful way. Tests usually test the wrong thing (e.g. mocks).
  * Only test how it will be used by a user
    * Only inputs and outputs, not implementations: even if that feels like you are just testing the underlying library do it because that is your interface / contract.
  * "What is the opportunity (not problem) we are trying to solve for?" - Ron Q.
    * Book: Continuous Discovery Habits
  * Goal -> Opportunity -> Solution
    * Identify goals and how opportunities relate to those goals before diving into solutions.

* Evolutionary design
  * Short experiments
  * Thin slices - LEAN
  * Empower teams
  * Fail (fast) to learn
  * Be intentional with learning
  * Embrace chaos versus (trying) to control choas.
    * Choas does not mean disorder.
  * Small, frequent dopamine keeps people motivated. Frequent little wins versus infrequeng big wings.
    * Release fast and often.
  * Engineers create product realitites.
  * Engineers are people pleasers.
  * Product owners should use langauge like "I would like ..." instead of "I want ..." when working our product details. The first is aspirational whereas the second is a command. This helps find solutions outside of the box because the box is never defined.
  * Estimates are guesses informed by experience in things being developed in the context in which it is being worked in.
  * Build in quality from the start to avoid longterm stagnation in which technical debt impedes flows to the point that only fires are being worked on. Plan for the marathon.
  * Technical debt is a buisness decision prevented by ruthless refactoring.
  * Technical debt is a fact of nature. Such as third-party frameworks or in-house become derelict because of external factors like AWS no longer supporting language Ruby v1.
  * Remove techincal debt when needed.
  * A good analogy for technical debt is that you can cook dinner in a pot today but at some point you will have to then clean that pot before you can cook dinner again. - Wyatt C.
    * Perhaps you have multiple pots so you can postpone this for a while, but eventually it must happen.
  * Trust engineres to do what is right at the rigth moment.

* DOJO Academy
  * Products are build through in-real-time cross dispiplinary collaboration, like a band.
  * Most scrum events are worthless - conversations are the most important element.
  * People who want to work together make a team / band successful, not people who are forced to work together.
  * End-to-end teams are an ensamble composed of everything needed to deliver something.
  * Teach and level up everybody by slowing down (e.g. paired / mob programming)
  * When driving a car, slowing down to make a turn is the safest way to change directions.
  * People learn in loops, how long those loops are depend on the individual and/or the organization.
  * DOJO Method:
    1. Frame challenge / opportunity
    2. Plan
    3. Do
    4. Share (30 minutes)
    5. Reflect (30 minutes)
    * 2 day cycles:
      * Monday: Frame + Plan + Do
      * Tuesday: Do + Share + Reflect
      * Wednesday: Frame + Plan + Do
      * Thursday: Do + Share + Reflect
      * Friday: Free / Contionus learning
  * Do mobbing with product owners, designers, etc. when needed: it is only a 2-day committment to crank out or resolve questions around the most valuable work.
  * Make decisions about socpe, issues, etc. every 2 days. This makes it very easy to pivot as assumptions are challanged and the scope of work is discovered.
  * Be intentional with what you want to learn from each iteration.

* Cross disciplinary mobbing
  * Happens all the time outside of programming
    * Surgery teams
    * NASA
    * Music
    * Ships
  * Most team efforts are cross disciplinary out of the box and have one shared missin / objective.
  * Cross disciplinary coding works well with "expert" mode in which the "expert" navigates.
    * An example is an engineer and UX designer mobbing to finalize QA before release. The engineer is doing the coding guided / navigated by the UX designer.
  * Mobbing reduces hand-off costs to 0. Code reviews, design discussions, brain storming solutions, etc. all happen in real time.
  * All decisions have diverse perspective and know by all as tribial knowledge.
  * Some teams employ static meeting location / URL in which anybody can join from inside the team or across the organization
    * Akin to office hours: easy to find the people you want to talk to for a second
  * "Everybody I need to deliver this is in the room" - ?
    * All focus is on the most important or valuable business problem to solve when working as a mob.
  * All authors of the Agile Manifesto have their own unique implementation of Agile, all rooted in Extreme Programming (XP).

* TEAL
  * Ron Quartel (FAST Agile) - Ron Q
  * Open Space is scalled Extreme Programming
  * You need local psychological saftey to expeirment, learn, fail, etc. Otherwise, you will never learn how to do better.
    * What if a toddler was never allowed to fall, how would they learn to run?
  * Dynamic reteaming around the work to be done aligns passion with work.
  * Self-organizing is not for everybody
    * Individual recognitision is sparse / non-existant
  * Can't control chaos, but can create structure to handle chaotic events
    * The market place is the single source of work / tasks so that organizational prioritizes are always clear.
    * Enforcing pairing / mobbing spreads knowledge and likekly facilitates learning in others if somebody in the mob is already an "expert".
    * Self organization aligns passion with work.
    * Autonomy enforces buy in and transparency over authority.
  * Dependencies between people manage themselves through conversations. No need for a controller (e.g. manager) to secretary those conversations / meetings.
  * Shared understanding of the opportunity the business is trying to realized / capture is critical. This requires transparency, otherwise, buy in is difficult.
    * When organizations lack buy in, authority is used to make up the difference.
  * Cliques work for delivery, but not innovation. Break up cliques to generate new ideas.
    * Facilitated by structures (e.g. innovation days)
  * People work better with meaning and purpose in their lives.

* Book: 9 Rules to Debugging

* Turning Agile Woo Woo into Action
  * Waterfall: I know what I don't like once it is done. Meaning there is a lot of wasted effort on things I do not want.
  * Agile: Iterative feedback throughout to avoid wasted effort.
    * Maximize the amount of work not done - a principle behind the agile manifesto
  * Book: XP Explained
  * Mobbing reduces hand off costs such as conversations around design, architecture, and trade offs because all members are aligned and working in the same context.
  * Mobbing forces reconciliation, so if there is ever uncertainty the mob reaches out for clarity every step of the way. This is a constant feedback loop from peers within the mob.
    * How to architect feature
    * Clarify business requiement
    * UX considerations
  * Introduce changes as experiments during retrospectives.
    * Keep experiments small, not sweaping.
    * Have to get buy in from the team, can't force it.
  * Agile Litmus Test: "When was the last time you changed something because of your Retrospective?" - ?
  * How an organization runs during a crisis is how it truely runs. During a crisis, people cut the fluff to be as efficient as possible.

* What is Product Ownership?
  * Constantly advocting for Customer Value to drive Business Value

* Agile Leader Community of Practice
  * Servant leadership
  * Transparency
  * No formal leader
  * Trust
  * Safe space / psychologyal saftey
  * Design effective working environments
  * Quality of Information
  * Executive coaching does not usually solve systemic cultural issues
