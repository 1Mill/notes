# Agile Open Northwest Camp 2022

* 2 day sprints to reorganize priorities
  * Constantly listening to feedback from the market and reprioritizing what the most valuable work is that should be done first.

* Some companies use commit message to reflect the type of work and the risk of the work being done. A refactor should hopefully have a risk score of 0 whereas a new feature might have a risk fater of `3` (whatever the organization designates that to mean).

* Evolutionary Design + Iterative Development
  * Feedback loop - only listen to signals that are real, not imagency. Program for the signals you see today not the ways you may see in 10 years.
  * Diversify ideas when at a crossroads. Spit into small groups for 1 hour to parellelize discvoery and experiment with differnt approaches.
  * Sunk cost falacy is exacerbated with deadlines. So ineffective ways of working continue to impede flow (e.g. building on top of technical debt, using ineffective working agreements, etc.) because a short-term slowdown may mean not meeting the short-term deadline.
  * Experiment on and with everything; always continue to iterate.
  * Need psychological saftey and maturity to cut costs and reduce wasted effort Maturity lets people recognize that what they are doing currently isn't working. Whereas psychological saftey lets people experiment and fail.

* mob models
  1. Everyone knows
      * Learn new things
  2. ...
  3. ...
  4. ...
  5. ...

* Heate / Love Scrum
  * Little value in cemeronies
  * Publish shaming is a common form of guilting people into join ceremonies.

* Software development philosophy
  * Functional, Clean, or Tested - Pick 2
  * Functional: What the customer wants (customer value)
  * Clean: Make it easy to read and change
  * More rules does not mean cleaner code.
  * Linters are another dependency in the system
  * Cultural guidelines are stronger to writing clean code over hard rules
  * Bad code is long, confuding, and inconsistent
  * Clean code is short with a clear intent (making it self documenting). It is also consistent in respects to file and folder conventions. Lastly, it does not include anything that does not make the intent more clear.
  * Testing takes a lot of time to learn and develop that skil in a meaningful way. Tests usually test the wrong thing (e.g. mocks).
  * Only test how it will be used by a user
  * Only inputs and outputs, not implementations: even if that feels like you are just testing the underlying library because that is your interface's contract.
  * "What is the opportunity (not problem) we are trying to solve for?" - Ron Q.
    * Recommended read: Continuous Discovery Habits
  * Goal -> Opportunity -> Solution

* Evolutionary design
  * Short expeirments
  * Thin slices - LEAN
  * Empower teams
  * Fail (fast) to learn
  * Be intentional with learning
  * Embrace chaos versus (trying) to control choas.
    * Choas does not mean disorder.
  * Small, frequent dopamine its keep us motivated. Frequent little wins versus infrequeng big wings. This means release fast.
  * Engineers create product realitites.
  * Engineers are people pleasers.
  * Product owners should use langauge like "I would like ..." instead of "I want.." when working our product details. The first is aspirational whereas the second is a command. This helps find solutions outside of the box because the box is never defined.
  * Estimates are guesses informed by experience in things being developed in the context in which it is being worked in.
  * Build in quality from the start to avoid longterm stagnation in which technical debt impedes flows to the point that only fires are being worked on. Plan for the marathon.
  * Technical debt is a buisness decision prevented by ruthless refactoring.
  * Technical debt is a fact of nature.
  * Remove techincal debt when needed.
  * A good analgy for technical debt is that you can cook dinner in a pot today but at some point you will have to then clean before you can cook dinner again. - Wyatt C.
  * Trust engineres to do what is right at the rigth moment.

* DOJO Academy
  * products are build through in-real-time cross dispiplinary collaboration, like a band.
  * Most scrum events are worthless - conversations are the most important element.
  * People who want to work together make a team / band successful, not people who are forced to work together.
  * End-to-end teams are an ensamble
  * Teach and level up everybody by slowing down (e.g. paired / mob programming)
  * When driving a card, slowing down to make a turn is the safest way to change directions.
  * People learn in loops, how long those loops are depend on the individual.
  * DOJO Method:
    1. Frame challenge / opportunity
    2. Plan
    3. Do
    4. Share (30 minutes)
    5. Reflect (30 minutes)
    * 2 day cycles:
      * Monday: Frame + Plan + Do
      * Tuesday: Do + Share + Reflect
      * Wednesday: Frame + Plan + Do
      * Thursday: Do + Share + Reflect
      * Friday: Free / Contionus learning
  * Do mobbing with product owners, designers, etc. when needed: it is only a 2-day committment to crank out all that work.
  * Make decisions about socpe, issues, etc. every 2 days. This makes it very easy to pivot as assumptions are challanged and the scope of work is discovered.
  * Be intentional with what you want to learn from each iteration.

* Cross displinary mobbing
