# Agile Open Northwest 2024

LINK

## Key Takeaways

* Focus metrics on the throughput of work at the team level, not the utilization of individuals. Having more hands on keyboards creates more activity making utilization metrics look good, but, it does not deliver value faster to customers. Instead, focus on reducing cycle time by creating slack in the system so people are waiting to jump on the next most valuable thing instead of adding to the cost of delay because they are too busy.

* High performance teams are happy teams with high emotional intelligence and psychology saftey. Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat, two senior fellows at Google, paired almost every day to scale Google from hard disk optimizations in the early days to tensors powering Google's AI systems today.

* Ask emotional questions to get emotional responses.

* A user story is a reminder to have a conversation: nothing more. In A cross-functional team, anything important will be discovered as part of doing the work.

* We need heuristics to be effective. However, unquestioned or unquestionable heuristics become dogmatic. Do not be dogmatic. Instead, be open minded and intentionally challange your own biases to continuously learn and improve. At an organizational level, competitors are constantly adapting and so not being dogmatic is fundemental to survival.

* To lead without authority build relationships, build credibility, and gain influence with decision makers to nudge change. This is inherently political and leading by example builds credibility. But, it doesn't have to be transactional. Instead, continuously try to build the environment you want to work in and where greatness can occur.

* Knowledge sharing ceremonies coupled with fluid reteaming create opportunities for the right people to contribute their best effort just at the right time to make the work as best as it could have been given the circumstances.

* The purpose of a team is to monetize customer value. Producivity metrics like velocity are one lense to observe and help improve throughput. However, productivity metrics become the primary goal for teams deteached from leading and lagging indicators.

* Ensamble programming is the best way to maximize throughput long term because the most important work is owned collectively. So, knowledge is organically shared without the need for complex documentation strategies, feedback is continuously provided without the need for formal review processes, and missing people are often not blockers to making progress. It does feel counter intuitive. On the surface, it feels like more hands on keyboards should deliver more working software. But, this isn't the case. Solo programming maximizes utilization at the cost of throughput whereas ensamble programming maximizes throughput at the cost of utilization with a lot less overhead.

* Agility, in part, comes from maximizing the amount of work not done. So, companies must continously improve in these three areas to work smarter and not harder to stay competative and alive:
  1. Make the work easier to do (e.g. improved tooling, new practicies)
  2. Make the work effortless (e.g. automation, reduce overhead, eliminate blockers to collaboration)
  3. Make the work unnessesary (e.g. scope hammering, automation).

* Finding more work to fill periods of wait solves the utilization problem but does not solve the throughput problem which is much more valuable. When the most important work is blocked teams shouldn't start less valuable work to stay utilized: they should start thinking about how to systemically solve the blocker. A WIP limit of one helps teams discover where their inefficiencies are and where to start improving to maximize throughput.

* Borrowing from Leadership is Language, Taylorism seperates thinking into blue and red work. Blue workers try to discover the "right way" of doing the red work whereas red work is done by "dumb labor" just following the instructions output by the blue worker. This seperation of thinking (blue) and doing (red) finds it way into today's teams where software engineers are not included in the blue work and just expected to code to the output requirements document. Innovation in the complex cynefin domain, where most technology buisness operate, comes from red and blue workers being the same people. Meaning teams must dedicate time to thinking and doing to continuously innovate.

* Queing and inventory are the biggest cost centers in Lean Manufacturing because of the logistics and costs associated with storage. Maintaining an storage of critical components is a min-max strategy to maximize throughput in manufacturing. However, such a strategy is not needed in product develompent. For example, ideas are abundent in product development so maintaining a backlog of old ideas provides almost no value. Instead, just in time pick the most interesting idea and continue working on it until it isn't interesting any more or something obviously more valuable gets discovered.

* Cultivate a team habit of tiny improvements. Tiny improvements over a long period of time compound significantly. However, before one can improve one must learn a new way. This can be ah-ha moments while doing the work. But more often it is intentionally learning from others. Allocating time for continuous learning is critical to cultivating a habit of tiny improvements enabling continuous improvement. Otherwise, teams get stuck in the capability trap where they only focus on doing the work, never improve, and stagnate until they finally collapse.

## Notes

### Opening Circle - Day 1

* Reference: Bays therom on forcasting
* Referece: Open Space Institute for other open space that exist
* Actively seek to understand new ideas, don't get caught up in confirmation or desirability biases
* Make learning cheap
* Is continous improvement the same thing as continous learning?
* Intentional practice is important to learning
* What is future backwards?
* Ethical non-hemogency
  * Avoid tokenization
  * Organizations reflect population
* Open Space is all about hallways conversations on the most interesting things people actually want to talk about
* How do we break down dogmat into change?
* Creating software is an inheretely creative process.
* Reference: Tuffle - A Visual Display of Quantitative Data
* Focus metrics at the team or business level, not the individual level
  * Possible to measure engineering productivity?
  * Story to story, code context changes which impacts productivity and impacts how reliable historial data is.
* GQM - Goal, Question, Metric
* Project Aristotel at Google
  * High Emotional Intelligence is associated with improved team performance
  * High psychological saftey is associated with improved team performance
  * The amount of code written is not associated with improved team performance
  * People happy and wanting to be there is linked with improved team performance
* Ask emotional questions to get emotional responses to get at the heart of tema issues
* Ensamble programming tells who is jelling with the team
  * Clear who is contributing
  * Clear who needs a break
  * Clear who is struggling
* The two Sr. Fellows at Google paired programmed every day until one of them left to go head their AI department in 2010s.
  * Reference: [The Friendship That Made Google Huge](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge)
* If people are in a competative environent, then game theory says sabotage is the best strategy.
  * Individual metrics invite competition
* How do you build a team identity versus a competative culture?
  * Can you do this while using individual metrics?
* Limit WIP enables agility
  * Allows people to be responsive to changes in the environment.
* "Name that tune" but for requirements
  * How little info do you need to solve the business problem?
  * Often, just the missoin statement (e.g. user story), not a bunch of requriements.
* A user story is a reminder to have a conversations - nothing more - because maybe that conversation will become obsolete by the time the conversation would happen and you want to minimize waste as much as possible.
  * Building a list of requirements encourages sunk cost falacy versus just deleting a single uesr story because you don't want that work building out requirements to be waste.

### I Are Wrong

* The things we believe in the most are where we are probably most wrong.
* Beleif probbly hides more and perhaps deeper insights
* Working as an ensamble is everywhere but writing code.
  * Music, surgurey, etc.
  * Coders seperate to do the work because of many beleifs often held by management.
* Work intentionally to confirm your personal bias.
* There is no end to open mindedness.
* Civilizations was not created as a great design by some single person, it evolved out of the complex domain for survival.
  * It is better to evolve and learn to survive than be rigid and die.
  * Each civilization evolved to work inside their own context - we can't copy and paste them.
    * We can try to adapt new processes to new contexts, but being rigid won't be successful.
* Reference: Byron Katie - Turnarounds - https://thework.com/2017/10/four-liberating-questions/
  1. Is it true?
  2. Can you absolutely know that it's true?
  3. How do you react when you believe that thought?
  4. Who would you be without the thought?
* Build relationships, build credibility, gain influence with decision makers to effect change.
* Questioning bosses is a politicl decision, but be sure to question yourself to continously improve the areas you can effect change in.
* How do you enable changes? Politics.

### Fast Agile

* Knowledge sharing ceremonies create opportunities for other people to become aware and jump in at just the right time to contribute the best they can to make the work the best it can be.

### Danger Of Measruing The Wrong Thing

* How do we measure productivity to justify budget?
  * Often, people want estimates, productivity metrics, etc. to justify cost or speculate on ROI.
  * Examples: number of commits, size of commits, lines of code
* Metrics encourage gamification so that people look good often time as the detrement of the work to be done.
* What behaviors do your metrics encourage?
* What people are left out from certain metrics?
  * Senior helping junior by pairing reflected in commit authorship?
* Every metric has an opposite reaction, so you may need many metrics to balance out.
  * Measuring number of lines of code may negatively impact code readibility.
  * Complex matrix optimization is required to balance pros and cons of metris - is this worth the effort or, challanging our belifes, is there better ways?
* What is the goal of a metric? What story is it trying to tell and who is trying to tell the story? And, can it be told differently?
* One metric to measure: Team Happiness.

### The State Of Agile #17

* Book: Built to Last
  * 5/6 companies have disappeared - so they didn't really last that long.
* Success as a business is mostly (if not all) about making money
* Teams / manages decouped from revenue metrics, so they focus on producivity metrics (e.g. velocity) to make activity look good
  * Velocity
  * Number of features released
  * Number of bugs fixed
  * Number of hours billed
* Teams lose site of success metric: $$$.
* Do teams need to justify their cost to sustain themselves? If a team only breaks even on the work they deliver, are they worth keeping around?
* Are there tangible versus intangible things not captured in $$$ metrics?

### Lunch - Day 1

* Mob Programming RPG to intentionally practice mobbing
  * Provides roles: driver, navigator, archivist, ...
  * Each role has unique abilities and inhibitors for practice in a real session
* Rotating in Ensamble programming is critical to keep everybody engaged and to level people up long term.
  * If somebody is never the navigator, they never learn to facilitate conversations.
  * If somebody is never the driver, they never learn to write code.
* Common rotation: Driver -> Navigator -> Achivist -> Observer -> Observre -> ... -> Driver
* With Ensamble Programming, the success unit is the team, not the individual.

### Dogma

* Assumed to be true without question - like an unquestionable axiom.
  * Emphasis on the unquestionable.
* Dogmatic: actions rooted in dogma.
* Sacred and dogma are very closely related concepts and sometimes overlap.
* Questioning org / team dogma is political because dogma originates from political systems.
  * "Don't rock the boat" is a common warning against challanging dogmatic beleifs.
* Appeal of dogma is it is a huristic to make decisions easy because we don't have to think about them any more.
  * Things that work become our habits - Reference: Kahneman.
  * Following well worn paths are easier than trail blazing.
  * Get things done faster because not stopping to think of alternatives is faster (in the short term)
* No such thing as good dogma - only good habits - because dogma cannot be questions.
* Good habits can be questioned and must be questioned regularly to ensure they are still good habits.
* Detecting Dogma:
  * Are there negative consequences for questioning it (e.g. idea, metric, company moto, etc.)?
  * Do people get angry when it is questioned?
  * "We don't have time for that"
  * "We need a more pragmatic solution" or other blocking statements as to why an idea may not be good enough or work here.
* Highlight keyword to detect underlying assumptions in statements
  * "Working with __too many__ people on __one thing__ __will be__ __too costly__."
* If we stop questioning, we stop innovating.
* Breaking down dogma isn't a single day activity.
* Always leave room for doubt.
* Book: Facilitators Guide to Paticipitory Decision Making.
* A product is living and must change to survive.
* "Divide and Conqueure" in the Art of War means to divide and overwhelm each division of the enemy one by one - not divide your army.
  * Divide the work into smaller chunks, not the efforts of the team - focus on one chunk at a time.
* To keep a product alive and perhaps get ahead, put effort into improving the system to make doing the work easier.
  1. Make the work easier to do (e.g. improved tooling)
  2. Make the work effortless (e.g. reduce overhead)
  3. Make the work unnessesary (e.g. scope hammering)
    * Agile is all about maximizing the amount of work not done.

### Post Product Owners

* Difference between Product Owner versus Product Manager? PO focuses on execution, PM focuses on strategy.

### Hiring for agility

* Make interview process match team practicies, like ensamble programming as an interview session.
* Work one day with the team.

### Agile Naked And Afraid

* How can an exeutive help the team? Servant based leadership. Not how can the team help the execuitive.
* How do leaders become part of the team from a bottom up approach versus an enforcer of policies from a more top down approach?
* Invite the team to the conversation to build agency and competency.
* Find ways to resonate with the team by meeting them where they are.
* Find areas of agility to "turn up the good" to help the team become more and more agile.
* Don't mention "agile" when trying to do a transformation. Show and tell, not theory craft. Feel the benefits.

### The 5 Ps

1. Passions: Things you do without any form of coercion or motivation; the thing itself is the reward.
2. Pensives: Things you are willing to do but usually require a bit of outside influence.
3. Prohibitions: Things you won’t do regardless of coercion or outside influence.
4. Peeves: Things others do that bother you.
5. Pedagogies: Things you want to learn or you are willing or able to teach others.

### Mob Game

* Use the Baba is You video game as a tool to teach / practice ensamble programming
* In an ensamble, learn when is and isn't the best time to share ideas with navigator.
* Trying things is better than talking about trying things and their hypothetical consequences most of the time.
* The moment you have an idea that can be tried, try it - don't carry on discussing it
* Talk at the right level of abstraction to the driver - something impacted by capability and context.
* Talking is okay, but not noise, to collaborate effectively.
* Strong Pattern: Only the navigator may speak unless the navigator gives permission to an observe to speak.
* To influence change, model desired team behavior individually, and then reflect as a team on that behavior.
* If not learning or contributing, then use the law of two feet.

### Utilization Considered Harmful

* Keeping everybody busy is costly because they cannot respond to change easily.
* We cannot trasnform or adopt new systems.
* A system will change / evolve because of the constraits imposed on it.
* "Go To Statement considered harmful" - Dijkstra.
* Unchallenged assumptions are costly.
* "The belief that everyone must be 100% tasked or we've wasted expensive staff"
  * How often do we challenge this belief?
  * What are the down sides / pitfalls of this belief?
  * What would happen if we ignored this belief?
* A 100% utilized road is gridlock
* Finding more work to fill period of waiting solves the utilization problem, but not the root cause creating the waiting period in the first place (i.e. the source of the waste).
  * If the most valuable work is blocked, we shouldn't start less valuable work to fill the time, we should work to eliminate the blocker.
* Roles lead to siloing and matrix management
  * Embrace multiple T-shaped people working as a collective unit instead of as individuals to keep work always moving forward even if it isn't perfect.
  * Often, the best we can do now is the best we could have done given the constraints.
* Activity feels like progress, but profits come from the delta between effort and captured revenue.
  * Maximize the flow of work to make work more profitable, not the activity of people to maximize utilization.
  * Commonm pitfalls are to focus on ever increasing velocity over increasing ROI.
* Constant context switching is fatiguing.
* Taylorism
  * Seperation of thinking versus doing work - blue vs red work in Leadership is Langauge
  * Assumes people are dumb
  * Recommended to break work down into simple, repeatable tasks for dumb people
  * Managers know the "right way" of doing the work

* Resource Accounting focus on maximizing utilization
* Throughput Accounting focuses on maximizing revenue producing items.
* We maximize for utilization, not throughput.

* Tradition is the cognitive quicksand of dogma.

* Queing and Inventory are the biggest cost centers in Lean Manufacturing because of the logistics and costs associated with storage.
* Donold Renerstein - "Invisible and unmanaged queues are the root cause of poor economic performance in Product Development."
  1. Lengthened delivery times
  2. Increased risk
  3. Lower quality
  4. poor morale
  5. Delay feedback
* "Queues are the inevitable byproduct of utilization. When workers are always busy, there’s no slack in the system to absorb surges, so work items must wait until someone has time to address them." - [Utilization Considered Harmful](https://jmlascala71.medium.com/utilization-considered-harmful-f992776e5e3e).
* Queing makes learning from bets more expensive and delayed.
* Build slack into the system to maximize throughput.
* Maximize just-in-time contributions.

* Inventory is waste because it is work we have done which hasn't delivered any value yet and is costly to manage
  * Backlogs
  * Unused code
  * Unused features
* Cost of delay is costly - often the opportunity cost is higher than any realized losses from under utilization.

* Capability Trap
  * More utilization, less time to improve
  * Capability erodes over time until it completely colapses.

* "Divide and Conquer" ... (repeated in the notes above)
* "Divide and Conquer" in the common sense only works if:
  1. No one must coordinate with each other.
  2. No one depends on anyone else.
  3. Integrating is trivial.

* Learn to again influence, learn to lead without appointed authority.

* Focus on the flow of work, not the utilization of individuals.
* People should wait for work, not work waiting for people.
* Slack is doing notheirng, not other work - people should be on standby ready to immediately start the next most important thing.

* Create en environment for good things to happen, but odn't dicate what those good things must be.

* Moments of idel time are irrelevant in the big picture and lifetime of the product.

### Continuous Improvement

* Continous learning enabled continous improvement.
* Be more effective in how we:
  1. Work
  2. Collaborate
  3. Create value
* How do you measaure continous improvement?
* CI can be applied to products, individuals, teams, etc.
* Leadership must be committed to CI during normal 8 hour working day.
  * W.Z.: 50% time dedicated to learning
* Learning gives a team options to explore and experiment with / try out
* Important to write down working agreements
* Important to write down experiments with hypothesis, otherwise, you are just messing around.
* Important to keep a history of expeirments and their effects to use as a reference for the future.
* Learning about and improve processes, environment, technology
* CI little and often versus big and infrequent - compounding interest.
* CI on principles and practicies is better than CI on tools and technology
  * Improvements to principles and practicies change systems which changes outcomes.
  * Improvements to tools and technologies are optimizations which change productivity locally - not systemically.
* If you do something manually 3 or more times, automate it.
* Cultimate a culture of learning, which means a culture not afraid of failure and sharing those failures.

### Closing Circle - Day 1

* Learning is a type of collaboration.

### Ensamble Programming - Day 1

* Use "On line 21.5" to mean create a new line below line 21.
* Hard to keep silane as observer in strong style where only the navigator is supposed to speak (unless they call on an observer)
* Rapid rotations stress test collective understanding of the work and working agreements / team agreements
* Best to practice roles / working agreements in low stakes environments because real stress will estroy working agreements.
  * Trial by fire is not a good way to practice new skills.
* Stand the navigator far enough away from the driver so they have to project their voice to ensure everybody has the same working context.

### Summary - Day 1

* Challange our assumptions to maximize flow and profit, which means learning new things and continously improving our ways of working

### Lean Coffee - Day 2

* Ensamble programming creats local culture which can make soloists on the same team feel isolated / excluded.
  * Sometimes people get curious and join the ensamble.
  * Sometimes people self-select off the team.
* Daily standups often change in purpose from peer-to-peer updates to team-to-management updates

* The CTO is responsible for technology culture (e.g. debt, framework, etc.) and enabling the business to deliver revenue-producing working software.

* Working agreements for the team in GitHub
  * Enable PR discussions
  * History is archived as part of the Git - people can't just go in and change things as they please without an audit log.
* Keep working agreements outside of the primary code repos - just make them their own repo per team to keep things clean.
  * Maybe a monorepo with codeownership would be good?
* 4 types of items:
  1. Policies - required approval from leadership to change
  2. Requirements - required approval from leadership to change
  3. Recommendations - requires approval from team to change
  4. Guidelines - requires approval from team to change
* Politices and requirements are imposed by leadership on the team whereas recommendations and guidelines are self-govered by the team themselves.
* If anything is missing, the working agreements are explicitly defined, easy to reference, and easy to modify.

* A story must have context about the "why"
  * Why is this important to the business?
* A story is different from a command: a story tells a story whereas a command is a telling.
* Use story dice to practice sharing / creating stories in a low stress environment.
* Getting all the details of a story is a protective habit, often from a bad experience rooted in miscommunication.
  * Lego Ducks: we were all given the same instructions to build a duck from a same set of lego peices but we all produced different looking ducks.
* Just need enough story to get started - finding / discovering the details is just part of the normal work flow.
  * Just in time conversations - not large requirements docs to reduce waste.

* No estimates
  * Can't predict the future.
  * Use time to do the work, not estimate the work.
  * Estimates are just a tool which may or may not work in a given context, such as the complex domain which most software is built.
  * Complicated domains have known veriables you can input (e.g. how much paint to cover a wall?), but complex domains have unknown cause and effect.
    * If cause and effect are well understood and commoditized, you are likely working in a complicated space.
* Time box estimates and add disclaimer.
* Reference: [Blink Estimation](https://dannorth.net/blink-estimation/)
* Estimates are usually used to spark a conversation, but, are ther ealternatives which achieve the same outcomes?
  * Cost-benefit? Just pick the most interesting idea -> do -> learn -> reasses. Don't be wasteful trying to do resource planning (i.e. people utilization planning).
* "People want to run software like a sign company" which is in the complicated space where variables are known and can be controlled for but software is in the complicated domain.
* "We want to make decisions based on the future, but keep failing" because we can't predict the future, so estimations continue to fail companies despite the massive amount of effort put into trying to make estimations better.
* We need to improve our budgeting process
  * Reference: Drip Funding - [DRIP Reinvestment plans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendreinvestmentplan.asp)
    * Reinvest money earned from working features back into those features.
    * Reinvest money into known revenue-producing products, features, teams, etc.
* Budgets often contribute to cost of delay - more time planning before doing reducing opportunity cost.
* Timeboxes prevent sunk cost.
* Discover the value by doing the work, not trying to predict the value through optomitic and bias estimates.
* Define people by their capabilities, not their roles.
* If the team is empowered, they will make good decisions
  * Need context
  * Need transperency
  * Need to know how work impacts customers
* "The team is their capabilities, not their roles"
* Forecasting is based on historical data versus estimations which are speculative. Use forecasting with expert opinion to try and make estimates slightly better, but, time box this to 10 minutes.

### Opening Circle - Day 2

* Reference: 6 minute interview
* Reference: The 9 rules of debugging
* Reference: Architectural fitness
* Reference: [Spoon Management/Theory](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/spoon-theory-chronic-illness)
* Reference: Tangrams for Learning
* Reference: [Clean Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_language)

### The 6 Minute Interview

* Code crafter jobs:
  * Know TDD
  * Know programming language
  * Know red, green (commit), refactor, (still) green (commit)

* Questions to ask:
  1. What does code craft mean to you?
  2. On a Likert-like scale, how familiar are you with ensamble programming from 1 to 5 where 1 is not familiar at all to 5 writing articles based off personal experience
  3. "...", how familiar are you with TDD from 1 to 5 where 1 is not familiar at all to 5 is "..."
  4. Do exercise with the applicant sharing their screen.
    * Exercise Setup
      * All the test are setup with placeholder names and are all failing.
      * The class being tested is setup with all the right methods but are just empty placeholders.
      * Some of the tests have slightly results <> expected setups
      * Write the class so it cann't be kept all in a person's head - add a lot of fluff.
    * Exercise Process
      * Speak throughout the process
      * Interup / prompt very little - you want to know how the applicant communicates and problem solves naturally.
      * They are free to use Google, etc. just as if this was a normal work day.
  5. After the exercise, ask follow up questions from things you saw during the exercise.
  6. Ask them if they have any questions.

* Look if the applicant understands the problem first before writing tests
* Get insights into the following areas to know if you want to invest more time:
  1. Know how to code?
  2. Know about TDD?
  3. Can explain thought process?
  4. Reading versus comprehension of problem to be solved
  5. Refactors code
  6. Conforms code to neightboring standards
* This interview setup shows instead of tells about applicant's capabilities
* Measure with time stamps:
  * When they first ran the tests
  * When adjusted tests
  * When fixed tests
  * When verified fix
  * ...

* Excersise and requirements bias towards a certain type of collaboration style for effective ensambling
* May give instructions in advanced to help set cretain expecations for people who self-identify as internal processors.

### Solutions Thinking

* Explore -> Develop -> Deploy -> Support -> (optional) Depricate
* Three spaces: Dev (D), Biz (B), Customer (C)
  * B+C make capabilities possible
  * D+B make promises to customers via marketing in exchange for $
  * D+B+C make strategy, finance, and technology work together to generate $
  * D+C makes customer value
* Each space (D,B,C) has a different perception of value
  * Promises are valuable to marketing so they can attract new customers
  * Working software is valuable to engineers to produce customer vlaue
  * Strategy is important to the business to sustain finances
* Lots of focus on marekting can lose sight of real customer needs and get stuck in the capabilities trap where you must deliver all the promises you made or customers will get mad.

### No Estimations

* Are we benefiting from estimates? If so, is there data to support this benefit?
* What parameters do we input into estimates?

* Work time: Doing the real work.
* Cycle time: From intake to done.

* An estimate is a guess for the amount of time to finish a project.
  * Often used to try to predict the future but often doesn't know until after because new things are discovered while doing the work
  * Want conversations to make decisions about budgeting (e.g. is this worth the time?).
  * Reframe as "Do we need this project? If yes, what parts exactly?"
* We need help making good decisions, which is often not influenced by estimations.
  * Do we need? -> yes -> do
* Good team, good place, good sponsor is what makes a project successful and delivered on time.
* "[Hofstadter's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law): It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law."
  * Things will fill the space given to them.
* Don't front load learning because you will only know what worked in that past context.
  * Often software development is in the complex domain, not the complicated, so you can't plug-and-play existing solutions from different contexts.
* Estimates are good for clear and complicated domains where paramaters are known and well understood, but not complex or chaotic domains where paramaters are not known or understood.
  * Complicated domains have equations you can plug and play into with well understood inputs - story points are not well understood inputs, hence why companies spend sooo much effort trying to improve how teams use story points

* Complex domain you must take action, sense, and then respond - no rules to follow or experts who can tell you exactly what to do - practicies must be emergent.
* Tactics and approaches change from domain to domain
  * Development maps to Complex domain
  * Configuration maps to Complicated domain
* In the complex domain, doing exposes reality.

### Community of Practice

* Do not mandate, just leave an open invite.
* Lead throught example, not authority as much as possible.

* Communities of practice must hav ea funnel to be sustainable long term.
  1. Awareness - people must know it exists and when it is happening.
  2. Consideration - Is this a place I want to be?
  3. Convert - I registr / go / particpiate.
  4. Loyality - Go again and again
  5. Advocate - Recruit or help administrate

* Look for network effects to attract participation
  * The more people, the more opportunities to learn something new.
* The place must be habitable
  * Affordable
  * Comfortable
  * Welcoming
* Boundaries exist between in and out groups

* Initiation:
  * Acknowledge new members
  * Make new people feel included / belonging
* Rituatls:
  * How do we act / behave as a collective?
  * The things we do to give meaning
  * Reevaluate rituatls frequently - don't become dogmatic
* Hub: The place of gathering
  * Can be physical or virtual
  * Must be persisted and easy to find
  * Centralized, but may have spokes for sub-communities.
* Stories: What we share that reinforces our community
  * Culture is a collection of stories
* Symbols: Things that represent us and our ideas

* Provide a map to the Inner Ring: so as people grow they know new ways to participate in the community.
* New -> Builder -> Emergent -> Leader
* Provide a clear path for people who choose to contribute more and at what effort level.
* Get people to think about what they can provide to the community as they grow.
* New people have better perspective of the community than leaders.
* When People leave, try to create a journey map of their participation to improve / change.

* Agile is too industrialized and so people are reacting negatively to the term "agile" today
* There is a brewing anti-agile movement because of how agile has been implemented within majority and laggard implementation.

* Building a community is a lot of work and hopefully becomes self sustaining eventually
* As leaders leave, the community should already have to the skills to continue on.

* What is the benefitial attractor to your community to get people to want to participate?
* Learn to recognize shift from group to community, and awcknolwege it and communities passion
* Find regular time to meet
* Start small, start local
* Be cognizant of the elements keeping the community together
  * Sense of belonging
  * Attractors

* To keep a community of practice, it must be lead by the community, not just by one person
  * Leaders should be able to be absent

* Make a community of out of the willing

* Reference: Beyond Agile Meetup

### Agile Leftovers

* Agile is not a collection of method, but a mindset
* Being agile does require action, and actions require practicies, but the practicies in themselves do not provide agility.
* Not all actions are appropriate for every context and any existing practice must evolve with new learnings
* In the agile manifesto, the ites on the left are more important than the items on the right (left over right => agile leverovers)

* Woody's Huristics
  1. Right must serve and support the left
  2. Right should support mulitple lefts
  3. Right must not detract from __any__ lefts
  4. Right may have some value, but does not mean we need it.
* Example: "Being fit and healthy over eating junk food": junk food may make us happy (a type of value) but it detracts from being "fit and healthy".

* Documentation ages instantly.

* Manifesto helps us understand how to evaluate practicies, but it does not tell us which practicies we must follow to be agile.
* We need processes and tools, but they should not inhibit conversations or limit individuals.
* You can't manage a team into agility.
* You can't manage productivity through more control.
* Self-Organized, Self-Managed, Self-Directed is the easiest path to agility

* Reference: Tidy First
* Reference: Modern Agile
* Reference: Innovation Curve
  * Agile is all about learning, but laggard are always about cookie-cutter practicies (not learning)
  * Practicies must be dumbed down to work in low-trust bureaucratic cultures over high-trust generative cultures.

* Agile Maxims by Woody Zuill
  1. It is doing of the work that we discuss the work we must do. Doing exposes reality. Do and Discover, engage and see.
  2. Technical Excellence.
    * Embracing change is impossible if our cide is not easy to read, maintain, grow, change, throw awway: all else is secondary.
    * Clean code, simplicity.
  3. Question Everything
    * The things we trust the most is likely where we are the most blind.
    * Keep an open mind.
  4. Working Software.
    * User are actually using it - not just released, but real usage.
    * Unused code is inventory which means expensive storage costs.
    * Get things into use quickly - doing and learning is better than analysis paralysis
  5. Stress diminishes value
    * Inhibits improvements
    * Create conditions to succeed, not just avoid blame.
    * True improvements come from helping other do better.
    * Protect people because it frees them to do their best work
  6. We are the innovators of our process
    * Learn -> Try, -> Validate -> Use?
    * Don't wait until ou are an expert to innovate / contribute
  7. The Environment
    * "The object isn't to make art, it's to be in that wonderful state which makes art inevitable." - Robert Henri
    * Liberate people, not diminish
    * Discover Excellence
    * Let people excell in both work and life
  8. Improvement
    * The more we work at the work, the less capable we become (capability trap)
    * Make time for improving capabilities
    * Study, automate, innovate
    * Dedicate 50% of billable hours to learning
  9. Disclaimer to always be able to change these maxoms

* There is going to be a lot of un-greatness before greatness.

### Failure to Communicate

* Show picture for 3 seconds so people get the same vague impression. Then, ask them to describe what they saw.
  * Eventually people will project meaning
  * Impression > Description => A picture is worth a thousand words when it comes to collaboration

* "The value of another's experience is to give us hope, not to tell us how or whether to proceed." - Petter Block
* "... I don't believe I can tell anybody what they should do. I can't tell you what you should do. So I really go along with this quote from Peter Block. I'm not here to tell you how or whether you should do this. I'm telling you why we did it, and how we did it. And then you can decide for yourself what you want to do. I think there's a lot of good in [the practice I'm about to present] and that's why I'm sharing it." - Woody Zuill

* We behave as if we understand what was communicated to us
* Communication for the most part is pretty successful
* Wiio's law: Communication usually fails, except by accident.
* Communication is all about the "exchange of information" toward a purpose
* Reference: [Four-sides model of communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-sides_model)

* What is the real purpose of communication?
  * Get and stay aligned
  * Shared understanding
  * Decision making
  * Accomplish something
* How do we know we succeeded? We don't until after the fact when we (hopefully) see the desired outcome.

* Deliver features for a theme of work until stakeholders get board of updates, at which point it means it is time to find new and more interesting work.
* Reference: Liminal Thinking

* Each person has a thin thread of attention which influences their "obvious truth" which is likely different from somebody elses "obvious truth"

* Senders often don't know what they are trying to communicate.
* Often, senders say too much or too little.

* We don't listen well.
* We cannot pay enough attention
* We cannot think and listen at the same time.
* We don't want to seem stupid so we come up with seeminly plausible justifications for questions people ask us
* We don't realize we didn't hear something so we try to fill in the blanks ourselves (bias) or from other context clues.

* Tips
  1. Communicate at a very high level with __no__ details.
  2. Comunicate details just in time, often as they are discovered / needed.
  3. Communicate face to face or side by side - walking helps
  4. Communicate in rapid loops (e.g. dialog)
  5. Verify through real observation the communication was effective
  6. Do the actual work together
    * Make my truth and your truth our truth.
    * More attention on shared experience to make our truth more robust
    * Diversity increases attention so people are looking out for different things
    * Verify in real time the communication was successful
      * Little successes keep morale up

* Only after fulfillment do we know that communication was successful.
* Verifying in real time helps street the work towards the desired result.
* Collaboration enhances communication.
* "Keep your eyes open, and let me know whwere you think we can improve"

* Any work that is late maybe isn't too important because the important stuff actually gets done.

* Reference: [Teaming](https://www.amazon.com/Teaming-Organizations-Innovate-Compete-Knowledge-ebook/dp/B007MF3BRA)
* Most organizations collaborate ineffectively through:
  * Meetings
  * Documents
  * Async messaging

* "What hs inhibited your effectivness in the last 3 months?" (TODO: look at photo)
  * Many symptoms of big problems related to collaboration
  * Many symptoms disappear with Ensamble Programming.

* What roles in creating customer value does a manager have? Are there alternatives that produce similar outcomes?

* People are practiced in working alone, not as a team, so habits are hard to break around collaboration.

### Ensamble Programming - Day 2

* Reference: [Approval testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW4sswrzL3s)
* TDD using Spec Style (deeply nested using context) versus xUnit style (strictly shallow)

### Lean Coffee - Day 3

* Same requirements, different ducks.
* Iterated based on what others did (e.g. wings)
* Reference: Lego Retros with Mike Bowler

* Be a consultant to influence without authority
* Build credibility person by person
* Small nudges
* Repetition
* Show passion
* Show by example
* Look for quick wins as building influence for big wins later on

* Preasure to deliver, not learn makes continous improvement difficult (capability trap)
* Spark curiosity - share ideas, articles, etc.
* Lead by example
* Meet regularly about a topic / interest
* You must change, which means you must learn - must adapt with market conditions to survive as a business

* "Go fix my people" is a common management approach to hiring consultants. But often, it is management that needs to change.
* Reference: How to coach video on SCRUM Alliance website

### Opening Cricle - Day 3

* Simple rules let organizations adapt to complex market environments
* Reference: [Lean Value Trees](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/lean-value-tree/)
* People like to optimize to make their work easy. Unfortunately, this means management optimizes to make managing easy which often makes the work more difficult.
  * Barriers to what people can and can't do
  * Micromanagement
  * Middle man to collaboration

### Visual Workspaces & Task Mapping

* How do you get alignment between product owner and engineering?
* Fast agile meeting all happens in Miro
* Reference: Task Mapping
  * Seems similar to Discovery Trees but J. Shore likes Task Mapping better.

* In a central hub inside Miro:
  * Add marketplace for in-progress work
  * Add working agreements
  * Add section for retros
  * Add section for syncs / Fast Agile meeting
  * Add section for PTO

* Miro is a living document with all the work and all the current working context.

* Value increment kick off stats conversation about expercations
* "Value Incremenet" (VI) owned by PM/PO, cards to deliver that VI owned by engineers / team.
* "Done-Done" checklist is the definition of done
  * Align around all the needs that need to be delivered and verified (e.g. security) before this VI is considered done.
* A VI is a discrete slice of work.
  * A VI is usable by customers
  * A VI does generate real customer value (not behind a feature flag)
  * A VI doesn't need more work to make the VI usable by customers - it is a standalone slice of customer value
* What is the essense of the VI and how do we deliver just that? This is a tough question to answer and takes a lot of intentional practice to improve.

* A user story is a reminder for people to have a conversation - not pass a list of requirements to.

* Reference: Planning Game
* Try to make VI 1-2 days max, which aligns for with the Fast Agile Value Cycle, but isn't always possible - but something to try to contionously strive for.
* Before a kick off, "Figure out what you can know, but be prepaired and comfortable to say 'I don't know'"

* Sections in Miro:
  * About the team (e.g. working hours, PTO)
  * Upcoming work
  * Marketplace for WIP, WIP limits, and current work assignments
  * Emergency items - must do now before any marketplace work
  * Marketplace is current priorities
  * Upcoming announcements
  * Working agreements
  * Best practicies / rules
  * Uncertain discovery in progress / on old
  * What may be coming in next to the the market place.

* When the work is done, delete the task map. Document elsewhere anything you may awnt to keep / are afraid of deleting.
  * The team work space is not the place for documentation - it is a place for the current work the team is doing so keep it tidy.
* What we did is not the most important historical context - delete it!

### Language Matters

* What are you not allowed to say?
* What are you not allowed to question?

* Say what you mean and mean what you say.

* Reference: Four-sides model of communication (linked above)

* What does "working software" mean?
* Teams often adopt the language of their manager / leader.
* Reference: Leadership is Language

### Immersion vs Trickle of Change

* Middle management is the embodiment of company culture.
* Reorganizations just cut middle management to quickly change company culture.
  * Can cause anxiety in employees
* Have to fundmentally change culture which is easier if a company can reset to a clean(er) slate.
* Culture is solidified by middle management

* You must have a culture of continous improvement, otherwise things won't change. This culture originates from leaders (who are often management).

* Do small changes to optimize, do large changes to change.
* Trickle down takes a long time to change significantly because it is so focused on optimizations versus large changes.

* Reference: Agile Fluency Game

### Almost Wardley Map On Genesis Of Agile Coaching And Methods

* Genesis and Custom Built is the place of complex domains, not so much Product or Commodity / Utility which are complicated and sometimes in the clear domains.
* Commodity phase is all about reducing costs.
  * Reason why 3-day Scrum course is now a 4-hour cert.

* Most agile courses today test knowlege recall, not comprehension or synthesis.

### Make It Easy

* Don't try to change company, help people learn their place to make their life better.
* Civilizations, like companies, raise and fall. Realize where you are and make it a fun place to be.

* Two responsibilities:
  1. Keep the business alive.
  2. Look for opportunities to improve how we work
* Reference: Atomic Haibts
* Tiny improvements are compounding
* A habit of tiny improvements is what we must strive for.

* "What has made it difficult for me to effectively get my work done?"

* Companies find themselves in cycle of no-improvment when only looking at symptoms, not looking at the system.
  * Taking medication for the flu only treats the symptoms: not the sickness itself.
* Todays solutions become tomorrows problems.
* We focus on only solving problems means we focus on solving only for symptoms.
* People like to optimize their work, so managers like to make managing as easy as possible.
  * Jira tracking does not make it easier to do the work, but it does make it easier to know who did do the work which managers find valuable to know about utilization metrics.
  * Lets make it easier to do the work, not harder.

* Reference: Liminal Thinking
* We need beliefs / huristics to be effective, but they also create blind spots.
  * Confirmation bias
  * Desirability bias
  * Surviorship bias

* Definition of System: An interconnected and interacting set of elements to achieve something.
  * Reference: Aurhur Jones Quote (???)
* There may be systems inside systems
* We see problems in the work, but this is an effect of the system. You must change the system to fix the problem.
  * Problems can also show up in sub-systems, so you may have to change the system many layers up.
* All complex systems evolved from a simple system -> We cannot plug and play systems, they must adapt and become new to work in new contexts.

* Systems either change or stagenate.
  * Change agents succeed, burnout, or get fired.
* Cynefin Domains: Clear, Complicated, Complex, and Choatic.
* Different tactics, practicies, etc. work differently in different Cynefin domains.

* Areas for continuous system improvements:
  1. Work smarter
    * Difficult to incentivise for things which never become a problem (no hero worship for avoiding distaters)
    * Capability Trap: No time to change or improve means stagnation.
    * Spend 50% of time improving
      * Try to do this as much as possible while doing the work itself - learning and delivery do not have to be mutually exclusive.
    * Embrace tiny improvements habit.
  2. Make it easy
    * Make it as easy as possible for everybody to do the best they can do.
    * Optimize for the flow of the work, not the activity or the utilization of the individuals.
    * Make people wait for the work, not the work waiting on people (uitlization trap)
    * Seek to get the best out of everybody in everything they do.
    * Make it as easy as possible for each person to do their best work.
  3. The bubble (because systems resist change)
    * Create a cultural bubble around adopters / innovators.
    * Must be supported by leadership / manager otherwise it will pop.
    * Make it the place you would want to work.
    * Make adapters which hook into the existing company culture so the existing system and bubble can work together in those key areas.
    * Expand bubble slowly, team by team, person by person. Let it grow and maybe subplant existing system long term.

* Create the space for small systems to evolve and let them evolve - there will be a lot of ungreatness before greatness.

### Lunch - Day 3

* Ensamble Programmers are the first hurrdle of accelerated continous improvement.
* Create Hub-Spoke breakout rooms in Google Meet for easy dynamic reteaming.
   * Be able to rename breakout rooms to say what each ensamble is working on so people can jump in / out without being disruptive.

* Definition of Done is a list with emojis used to indicate what is and isn't done
  * Use good visual design (e.g. shapes, colors)
  * Take screenshots as status updates when needed
