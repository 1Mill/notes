* Spreading technical practicies

    * Dedicated learning hours
  * Hunter Industries has 7 dedicated learning hours per week. Use Microsoft Teams to host group learning sessions - like Katas on design patterns.
  * Found success with regularl Katas to level up everybody in the org
  * Find a peice of legacy to refactor as a mob on a regular basis to (1) share knowledge on how the code works and (2) establish software design patterns like a Kata.
    * One person did it 15 minutes every day and recorded the session to build a repositiroy of practicies to reference in the future
  * If you teach something you learn it better
  * Weekly mob refactor on production code
  * Stuggle to communicate practicies between teams because every team is so siloed. 
    * Remote work makes this even more difficult because less hall-way conversations to get the bigger picture
    * https://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/04/04/the-dailies-a-new-way-to-learn-at-work/ - host dailies to have conversations with others in the organization
    * Not enough slack in the system to focus on anything except for output (e.g. coding features)
  * Diffusion of innovation theory
    * Get buy-in from early adopters to then evangelize it to effect change.

  * "Never stop learning" - Art Bergquist
* What practicies are "non-negotiable" at various org scales?
  * CICD
  * Infastructure as Code so that you can focus on business value rather than taking care of pets
    * Pets versus cattle infastructure. Pets you have to take care of, cattle are more replacable.
    * Terraform
  * Running tests as part of CICD so that tests never diverge from intented system behavior.
