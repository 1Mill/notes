## Key takeaways

* Games break down social barriers and help people bond over shared experiences - shared experiences which promote psychological saftey.

* Psychological saftey makes teams (and people) more creative, communicative, and critical of the anything because they can safely challange the status quo and brainstorm new ideas.

## Notes

* Count 1 - 20 in order, if the same number is said more than once restart the count at 1
  * Systems / order emerge from chaos - people self-select and communicate the number they will say (aka self organization)
  * People innovate organically
  * People are more likely to turn on their Zoom cameras to help communicate
* Games break down social barriers by getting people to work together to solve a common problem

* Teams struggle with communication - people often work as individuals not as a team. Partly because people do not have psychological saftey within the team.
  * This does not mean people are actively attacking their ideas but rather that team bonding never occured so people defaulted to looking out for themeselves

* Lack of team communication caused a lot of rework because software architecture ideas  were not being discussed upfront or were missing requirements
* Self-first encouraged people to hide pitfalls they discovered out of fear of missing their personal sprint committments
  * People stay busy instead of focusing on solving problems

* Teams with psychological saftey are creative, have improved communication, and do not hide problems and instead address them.

* Psychological saftey
  * Environment in which people are more accessible
  * Communicate with honesty
  * Challenge and make suggestions
  * Critically take action on those suggestions

* Innovation happens organically when psychological saftey is present because people can safely challange the status quo or ideas presented by more senior people

* Gamification
  * Ice Breaker Questions (e.g. "If you could have the power of teleportation right now, where would you go and why?")
  * Celebrate Failure (e.g. "First feature where you broke the application or caused a sev 1 issue?")
* Async prompts in Slack every other Friday - "Fun Session Fridays"
  * Make questions open answered
* Pick questions that reveal something about your team  - "What is your favorite ice cream?" is very surface level.

* Leaders sharing their funny mistakes (e.g. crashing production) make people feel more comfortable to share their own
  * Celebrate failures

* Do 1 hour ask-me-anything sessions with anybody, particularly senior leadership. Take questions async over Slack or however.

* Changes after psychologicated safey was created
  * People started haveing more open discussion
  * People started connecting more
  * People started working more as a team
  * Delivered faster
  * Reduced cycle time

* Scrum Masters / Agile Coaches should teach their way out of their job - teams should get to a point where they are self problem solving.
