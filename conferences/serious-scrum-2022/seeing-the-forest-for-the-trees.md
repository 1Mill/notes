## Key Takeaways

* Bureaucracy is the root cause of wait in systems. It encourages specialization focused on isolated localized costs at the expense of cycle time.

* Instead of a chain of specialized teams that require hand-offs to produce customer value, create generalized cross-functional teams that can produce end-to-end customer value with as few external dependencies as possible.

* Visualize and measure cycle time from Customer Request to Done through Value Stream Maps. With a value stream map you have something you can start experimenting on to reduce cycle time.

## Notes

* Reference: No Nonsense Agile Podcast

* Organizational structures can (and mostly do) artifically increase cycle times because of hand offs and lack of shared priorities between teams.
* Cost of Delay (i.e. blocked) work is a factor commonly not observed in many companies and is compensated for with high WIP limits
  * Focus on maximizing utilizatin of people versus flow / cycle time of work
* Direct impact
  * Process efficiency = number of days productive days / number of total days
    * Can also do by hours, days, or whatever unit of time
    * Example: 2 of work / 60 of cycle time = 3% efficiency
* Indirect impact
  * How much does a delay cost?
  * If a WIP limit is 1, how much idel time would have that delay costed the company?

* Customer Request -> Started -> Doing -> Done
  * Delivery Cycle Time: Time from Customer Request to Done
  * Throughput Time: Time from Started to Done
  * Usually there are periods of wait throughout this process
* Wait in any form does not provide customer value

* Root cause of wait: bureaucracy
  * Produces hierarchy
  * Focus on cost reducing costs versus flow
  * Reductionist philosophy: break work down into steps for specialized teams to handle as efficiently as possible.
  * Specializes teams optimize locally at the expense of the whole
  * Intake highly detailed requests form to offload thinking / working as a team
  * Output most efficient (low quality) results to maximize local KPIs
* Major hand offs between teams cause major delays and incurse huge costs
* Teams constantly context switching
* Each team lacks insight into overall costs because they are so focused only on their KPIs
* Hierarchtical management usually sets narrow KPIs for subordinates so that nobody is thinking about the big picture (i.e. cycle times, overall costs)

* Create Value Stream Maps to visuallize and measure the end to end process from a customer's perspective
* Orgnize the work to be done in customer focused ways with cross-functional end-to-end teams
  * Reduce external dependencies
