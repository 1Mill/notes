## Key Takeaways

* FLUID Scrum is a compromise between FAST Agile and Scrum. Like FAST Agile, it benefits from dynamic reteaming so that the team (in FLUID Scrum, tribes in FAST Agile) has the right people working on the right work. FLUID Scrum does this by defining a team as 20-50 people who self-organize into small squads every sprint. Each team is capabile of end-to-end delivery. In a traditional sense, this means the team is composed of designers, product owners, scrum masters, engineers, data anlytics, etc. to drive a feature from ideation to done. This pool of people self-organize themselves into smaller squads to focus exclusively on a sprint goal.

* FLUID Scrum process looks like
  1. Team planning to define sprint goals
  2. People self-organize into squads to meet sprint goals
  3. Squads perform scrum events (e.g. stands ups, retros, planning, etc.) independently
  4. At end of the sprint, dissolve squads
  5. Retro as a team.

* The self-organizing nature of FLUID Scrum (1) aligns personal passion with work to be done to promote ownership and (2) maximizes team flow because if somebody cannot contribute to Squad A they can jump to Squad B. If somebody is not passionable about their assigned work in traditional scrum or do not have the skills to contribute to the sprint goals that it unutilized capacity. A good and perhaps common example is engineers doing nothing while designers design and designers doing nothing while engineers engineer. In reality both work on non-sprint goal related outcomes (e.g. next feature ticket, bugs) but FLUID Scrum brings that to the surface.

## Notes

* Scrum is misunderstood
* Silos lead to misalignments and delays
* Team collectively knew everything they supported and were able to self-organize themselves into smaller groups / squads when needed to parellize work.
  * -> Sounds very similar to FAST Agile
* Team was forced by management to break team into 3 smaller teams to be more by-the-book scrum.
  * Loss of big picture / overview
  * Reduced sense of ownership
* FAST Agile
  * Solve complex problem as a group and spit into smaller groups to execute
  * Re-team every couple of days
* FLUID Scrum has normal events like stands ups, retros, etc. and normal accountabilities like PO, engineers, and scrums masters to coach teams, and all other rules. Only rule change is size of the team.
* Small stable teams are not in the scrum guide.
* Scrum teams organize themselves around the work at hand (lifted from FAST Agile)
* 20 people organize themselves into 2-3 scrum teams to tackle specific subthemes of the work
* Scales up to 50 people
* FLUID Scrum process:
  1. Team Sprint Planning to define sprint goals
  2. Self-organize team into squads around sprit goals
  3. Each squad performs scrum events (e.g. standsups, retrospectives) independently
  4. At end of spring, dissolve squads
  5. Perform team retrospectives
* Large pools of people to self-organize from ensure a wider set of skills to tap into to meet sprint goals.
  * A designer can work on project Z for one sprint, and then project Y for the next sprint instead of being bottlenecked by engineering.
  * If a member cannot contribute to one squad, they can jump to another squad. In a stable team, they cannot contribute and is wasted capacity.
* Self-management increases ownership because people are more engaged with the work they choose to work on.

* Levels of fluidity in FLUID Scrum [in relation to (Cynefin framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework) in my opinion)
  * Complete fluidity: Completely disband and build new squads every sprint because work is chaotic
  * Partial fluidity: A few people stick around in persistant squads because work is complex
  * Specific fluidity: A few people float around between persistant squads because work is complicated
  * No fluidity: Squads stick around for a while because work is clear
