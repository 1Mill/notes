## Notes

* Change is difficult
* Road mapping to far into the future is draining and time consuming. Constant worrying about how valuable work X, Y, and Z is really.
* More rules does not produce better road maps
* No room for learning, experimentation, or innovation: everything was already "figured out" and set in stone.
* Every team focusing on this own silo of the roadmap means that dependencies across teams were usually hacked together as a work around.
* Feature Factory Mindset: Feature -> ship as fast as possible -> Value
  * Is this really valuable? No room for critisism after roadmap is set.
  * Waterfall mindset in throwing requirements over the wall to the next team (e.g. business -> IT).
  * Happens across all industries, not just technology sector
* Reality of delivering value is that it is messy and uncertain and sometimes provides value but is not a garuntee.
  * Telling a joke does not mean people will always laugh.
* Output versus outcomes
  * "The effort in your product only shows to the extent in it makes a differnce to your customers" - Maarten Dalmijn
  * People do not care about features, people care about completing their goals.
  * Outcomes are hard. Customers will tell you features they think they want but they will not tell you what their goals are.
  * Tightly coupled: you cannot produce outcomes without output. Outputs drive outcomes.
* Outcomes are lagging indicators / metrics.
* Features as easy to talk about because they are outputs.
* North Star
  * Single metric that captures both customer value and business value.
  * Spotify: Time spent listening to music.
    * If customers listen to more music than most customer value is being produced
    * If more people sign up than more business value is being producted
  * Important to capture duality of customer value and business value.
* North Start + Constellation of Inputs
  * Inputs create hypothesis tree: levers to pull that should effect north start metric.
* Triple Track Agile
  * Discovery (fast), Delivery (slow), Validation (very slow)
* Sucked into the Sprint Bubble is when a team only focused on the sprint at hand: not working within the context of the bigger product picture.
* Scrum teams must work beyond the Sprint Horizon. A team need to cover all 3 feedback loops.
  * Past sprints (validation)
  * Current sprint (delivery)
  * Upcoming sprint (discovery)
* The current sprint should not be the main feedback loop for teams or organizations.
