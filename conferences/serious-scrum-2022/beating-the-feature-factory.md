# Beating the feature factory

## Key Takeaways

* If an org is running multiple projects, then cross-team collaboration becomes unreliable. Teams self-organize around valauble work to themselves. So if Team A and Team B are planned to work on Project X together, but Team B is still working on Project Y. Perhaps because of overrun deadlines, bugs, scope creep, etc. then Team A and Project A are left hanging. To unblock themselves to stick to the established roadmap plan, Team A usually finds a workaround. This rigidity in long term roadmap planning does not leave room for learning or doing better: it is just go-go-go.

* The Feature Factory Mindset (2FM) is to deliver work as fast as possible becuase delivery is easy to talk about: did it get released? Yes or no? It is much more difficult to talk about how that delivered work impacted the North Star metric. Delivered work is fast and gives the appears of doing something meaningful. However, you can only validate if work is meaningful if you can demonstrate it positively effected the North Star. This validation feedback loop is very long though.

* North Star with a Constellation of Inputs (NS+CI) is akin to Structural Equation Modeling. It is a way of describing how delivered work trickles up the chain to effect the North Star metric. The North Star metric itself is a goal that captures both customer and business value. For example at Spotify, "Time spent listening to music" is their North Star. If customers are listening to more music, than Spotify is providing customers with more value which hopefully translates into more sign ups.

* Teams need to focus on more than just delivery. The Tripe Track Agile (TTA) frameworks suggests there are 3 feeback loops team need to listen too: (1) validation of past work on the North Star, (2) delilvery of known work, and (3) discovery of future work. These feedback loops operate at different cycles but keep teams aligned and aligned around the most valuable work. For example, if a buggy feature is negatively impacting the North Star, then turning that feature off may make business sense. Or, perhaps fixing those bugs will inverse that impact. Something to discover.

## Notes

* Change is difficult
* Road mapping to far into the future is draining and time consuming. Constant worrying about how valuable work X, Y, and Z is really.
* More rules does not produce better road maps
* No room for learning, experimentation, or innovation: everything was already "figured out" and set in stone.
* Every team focusing on this own silo of the roadmap means that dependencies across teams were usually hacked together as a work around.
* Feature Factory Mindset: Feature -> ship as fast as possible -> Value
  * Is this really valuable? No room for critisism after roadmap is set.
  * Waterfall mindset in throwing requirements over the wall to the next team (e.g. business -> IT).
  * Happens across all industries, not just technology sector
* Reality of delivering value is that it is messy and uncertain and sometimes provides value but is not a garuntee.
  * Telling a joke does not mean people will always laugh.
* Output versus outcomes
  * "The effort in your product only shows to the extent in it makes a differnce to your customers" - Maarten Dalmijn
  * People do not care about features, people care about completing their goals.
  * Outcomes are hard. Customers will tell you features they think they want but they will not tell you what their goals are.
  * Tightly coupled: you cannot produce outcomes without output. Outputs drive outcomes.
* Outcomes are lagging indicators / metrics.
* Features as easy to talk about because they are outputs.
* North Star
  * Single metric that captures both customer value and business value.
  * Spotify: Time spent listening to music.
    * If customers listen to more music than more customer value is being produced
    * If more people sign up than more business value is being producted
  * Important to capture duality of customer value and business value.
* North Start + Constellation of Inputs
  * Inputs create hypothesis tree: levers to pull that should effect north start metric.
* Triple Track Agile
  * Discovery (fast), Delivery (slow), Validation (very slow)
* Sucked into the Sprint Bubble is when a team only focused on the sprint at hand: not working within the context of the bigger product picture.
* Scrum teams must work beyond the Sprint Horizon. A team need to cover all 3 feedback loops.
  * Past sprints (validation)
  * Current sprint (delivery)
  * Upcoming sprint (discovery)
* The current sprint should not be the main feedback loop for teams or organizations.
