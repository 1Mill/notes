## Key Takeaways

* Use opportunity solutions trees (OSTs) to visualize how business opportunities / customer problems link to business outcomes. Additionally, use OSTs to communicate solutions to customer problems and how these solutions will be experimented on to provide supporting evidence that they are solving the root customer problem and it is having the desired impact the linked business outcomes.

* Ask and verify important questions about product market fit and solving the most valuable problems to reduce waste. Building a feature nobody uses is a huge amount of waste. Additionally, try to mitigate risk through the Product Trio (PT). The PT is composed of a product manager (business viability), designer (usability / UX), and engineer (technology feasibility) do discovery work together (e.g. customer interviews, brainstorming solutions) so that experiments are as well informed as possible before committing more resources (e.g. time, money, etc.).

* Not every idea needs to be tested. Some ideas are high value with low risk and should just be done. Other ideas are low value are may just be ignored completely. However, ideas that are high risk and high value should be tested thoughtfully. Prototyping is a strong start to validate ideas and usability before moving to A/B testing which requires more expensive code. The goal is to learn as safely and cheaply as possible.

## Notes

### Why do we need product discovery?

* Are we building the right thing?
* Are there customers for our product?
* Is there a market for the product?
* Do we have product market fit?
* Are the problems we trying to solve the most valuable?

* Most ideas do not work
* Most work takes several iterations before demonstrating value
* Iterate on products using prototypes, brainstorming sessions, etc. before even starting to write code

* Four risk
  * Value. Will it create value for our customers?
  * Usability. Will users figure out how to use it?
  * Viability. Can our business support it? Does it align with our business?
  * Feasibility. Can it be done (technology)?

* "The output of product discovery is a validated product backlog"

### What's inside the product discovery process?

1. Understand and define the problem being solved (opportunities)
2. Explore possible solutions to that problem (ideas)
3. Formulate testable assumptions
4. Run experiments to support or disprove assumptions

* Product Trio (PT) composed of a product manager (viability), designer (usability), and engineer (feasibility)
  * Provide diverse perspective from all parts of the business
* Book: Continous Discovery Habits
* Do PT in parellel to delivery - split discovery work from delivery work
* Important to have all people present in PT in all meetings to include a whole complete perspective

* Opportunity solution tree to visualize business outcomes, customer problems (opportunities), and potential solutions (ideas) to be experimented with
* Use 5 whys to get to the root cause during customer interviews
* "Why solve this problem versus others?"
* Do not ask customers for solutions, instead, ask customers for problems.
* Ask customers questions about how they solved a problem, do not ask them what they like or do not like about your product.

* Test assumptions of solutions and how they will relate to a higher order opportunity - do not test solutions themselves.
* Example:
  * Business outcome: Reduce customer churn
    * Opportunity: "I can't figure out how to search for a specific show"
      * Solution: Display a search box
        * Experiment: Displaying a search box will help a customer find a specific show
      * Solution: Recommendations
        * Experiment: Displaying recommended shows will help a customer find a specific show
    * Opportunity: "I can't find anything to watch"
      * Solution: Recommendations
        * Experiment: Displaying recommended shows will help a customer find something to watch
* Some solutions may span multiple opportunities

* Templates for writing a good experiment:
  * Addressing [opportunity] will drive [outcome] because ...
  * [solution] will address [opporunity] because ...
  * [solution] is feasible because ...
  * We will confirm users know how to use [solutions] by ...
* [experiment] must always target an [opportunity] through a proposed [solution], and, an [opportunity] must always target an [outcome].

* Story Map
  * See how a user interacts with a product and how the product interacts
  * Add "desirability" to denote a users intent in that window
  * Add "usability" to write down assumptions about what knowledge the user must have to interact with the product in that window
  * Add "feasibility" to write down technology solutions that address a user's desirabilities.

* Reference: Jeff Gothelf, Hypothesis Prioritzation Canvas
* Only test ideas that are high value and high risk; just ship any high value but low risk ideas

* "Focus on opportunities, not solutions"
* Focus on understanding problems, needs, and desires in-depth
* Prioritize opportunities - not solutions
* Do not let customers design solutions - "product death cycle trap"
  * Customer do not know what is possible or what is a shared pain point across the domain

* Test experiments through high and low fidelity prototypes because they are cheaper than code as much as possible
* Prototypes test UX cheaply
* A/B testing in code is more expensive so figure out usability stuff as much as possible before hand

* "A product is a vehicle to deliver value. It has a clear boundary, known stakeholders, and well-defined users or customers." - Scrum Guide 2020

* We don't need to test every ideas - only the most risky ones.
* Some ideas are worth just doing without testing; others are not worth doing at all.
* Do product discovery every week just like delivery work
* Only place meaningful experiments in the backlog - keep all incomplete ideas somewhere else or not at all
