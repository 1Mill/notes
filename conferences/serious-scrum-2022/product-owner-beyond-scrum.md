# Product Owner Beyond Scrum

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Wp-suAC7s&list=PL3bwi3QF6gpi492UWYhhipnsuib23_Iq1&index=4>

## Key takeaways

* People are the most important aspect of organizations. When the human element is removed from the process, empower teams to challange that status quo to effect change.

* Make every process simple with the intent to facilitate conversations between people.

* Organizations (and Product Owners) missing a vision or strategy cannot meaningfully work because there is no common ground to juxtapose ideas.

* Prioritization is a bet, so make these bets cheap and easy to pivot from. Plans are a false sense of security in which reality is assumed known and fixed.

* To be a successful organization, focus on ideas that intersect customer needs with the vision and technology capabilities of the organization.

## Notes

* Have to go beyond Scrum to succeed
* Status quo in most organizations
  1. Group of people decide on what needs to be done when
  2. Figure out capacity graph (i.e. roadmap)
  3. Throw it over a wall to do-ers who scramble to meet deadlines
* Status quo gives product owner limited responsibilities which makes them become "waiters"
  * Gather requirements (take food order)
  * Manage stakeholder expectations (advis dietary resrictions)
  * Maintain large backlog
  * Create new features
  * Ensure teams meet deadlines (ensure team cooks food exactly)
* Wrong focus on pleasing stakeholders versus focusing on what customers need
* Wrong focus on writing better user stories versus have conversations with teams to discover solutions
* Wrong focus on maximizing the number of features versus what customer need
* Wrong focus on precise estimations for capacity graph (i.e. roadmap deadlines) versus learning and adjusting
* Wrong focus on avoiding mistakes at the detrement of learning and creativity
  * Teams become unmotivated because they become simple doers who can't think about their work
* Wrong focus on solutions space versus learning how to meet customers needs
* The faster we fail the faster we learn
* Common mistakes people think
  * Scrum is a delivery framework
  * Output over outcomes (focus on number of features versus customer value)
  * Managing over leading (lead by context or volunteerism versus authroity / control)
  * Backlogs are important
* Output over outcomes happen when steakholders pressure teams to deliver more features
  * Google is a great example of simple to satisfy customer needs
* Following plans over embrasing the unknown
  * Plans give false sense of security
  * Perspective roadmaps lead teams in pointless directions
  * Must be able to articulate the problem the team is trying to solve on behalf of the customer.
* Opinions over evidence
  * Highest paid person in the room calling the shots (HIPPO)
  * Meeting arbitrary deadlines is thought to be more important than leaning from customers
* Risk avoidance over exploring opportunities
  * A lot of empahsis on "mitigating risks" is not a focus on learning
* Where you put your focus is where you can drive things
  * If you put your focus on avoiding risk, you will avoid risk but miss opportunities
  * If you maximize opportunities, you will learn to deal with risk as they are discovered
* Fear of failure destroys change of innovataion
* Empowerment isn't given. You must earn it.
  * Sometimes you have to read between the lines and deliver result to earn trust
  * Sometimes you have to build relationships
  * Remaining in the comfort zone will not build trust
* Steve Jobs always shared ideas very strongly, but would always ask "what is wrong with the idea?" to be challanged to build more robust ideas.
* Product Owner Health Check
  * Product vision
  * Product strategy
  * Product goals
  * Business model
  * Value proposition canvas
  * Naming assumptions
  * Testing assumptions
  * Learning from failures
  * Measuring outcomes
* Without vision or strategy, everything else is meaningless
* Sunk cost falacy happens all the time with effort
* "Assumptions are the matter of all fuck ups"
* If you can name an assumption, you can then try to observe it.
* Asking questions that lead to "no" can lead to interesting conversations
* Moving beyond scrum
  * Empowerment x learning speed
    * TODO: Add photo
  * Phases of scrum
    1. Faster Waterfall (4 week, 3 week, 2 week, etc. sprints)
    2. Feature Factory
    3. Value Driven
  * Product teams need to untrap themselves so try to identify problems worth solving
    * Customer x Business x Tech venn diagram - balance all 3
      * Customer + Tech: Desirable and feasible but not viable (burn money, maybe longterm investment)
      * Customer + Business: Desirable and viable but not feasible (take forever, never get done)
      * Business + Tech: Waste (customers don't want it, we assume we know their needs)
    * Simplify prioritization
      * Potential Impact x Easiness of Implementation
        * Low impact, low ease = waste
        * Low impact, high ease = nice to have
        * High impact, low ease = bet
        * High impact, high ease = value maximisers
    * Prioritization Aspects
      * Potential business outcomes
      * Customer revelence
      * Number of impacted customers
      * Potential to differentiate
      * Ability of solving the problem
  * Do not plug graphs into "value calulations" and priorize based of that. Have a conversation! Prioritization is a bet: don't do it blindly.
  * Simply and try having more meaningful conversations
  * Encourage teams to step back, reflect, and challange the status quo.
  * Do not accept the status quo as unchangable.
