## Key Takeaways

* TODO

## Notes

* Reading your system
* Hiearchy is an optimization from the bottom up (REFERENCE: Thinking in Systems)

### All things I misunderstood about being a leader

* Leadership is about building frameworks for success - not control
* Create space and boundries for teams to have great ideas.
* People must be bought in, so hunt for missionaries, not mercenernies.
  * As lead, your ideas are HIPPO ideas
* "What do you want me to deprioritize to focus on this?" - quite to build alignment with stakeholders / bosses
* Leaders define outcomes, not solutions
* Leaders should spend most of their time not changing priorities, teams need time to execute

* Teams must get it to delivery effectively: Clarity, Stability, Confidence.
* "How often does my roadmap not change?"
* Hold roadmap for 90 days to 6 months ideally.

* Leaders want to wait to gather more information lead to passionate ideas getting dropped
  * "Let's revisit next week" is the phrase that kills passion / motiviation

* Advice process
  1. Ask for feedback
  2. Set deadline
  3. Act

* You learn more by shipping the wrong thing that trying to debate what the right thing might be
  * Real customer feedback is better than hypothetical feedback
* Learn fast by making failure safe.

* Helocopter parenter prevents opportunities for growth -> Let people learn by doing
* Don't be a martyre by compensating for people's lack of capability -> level folks up
  * Address issues now, don't let them linger
* "I think you are capable of X, but ... level up"

* Process outlines desire path, it shouldn't become the work itself; process is not the point.
* Metrics must align / impact outcomes, otherwise people get distracted with busy work which doesn't relate / drive profitability.

* Power is what bad leaders leverage when tey can't earn trust or respect
* Leadership is not an individual persuit, it requires community / others
  * You are on the team, not above the team

* **Key takeaways**
  * Leadership is not something you do solo, it requires community / others to want to follow. When authority must be used to force follows, then it means there is a breakdown in clarity, stability, and/or confdence in the leaders.
  * Leaders often build systems to contro. Instead, the mission of a leader should be to build systems which level people up (i.e. build organizational capabilities) while delivering profitable work. This dual mandate requires leaders to build focus so teams can execute effectively and create the space for people to learn and fail safely while doing the work. Learning through doing is the best feedback.

### No one left behind

* Critical to know your team
  * Who can work under what situtations?
  * How do they burn out?
* Let people choose their own paths
  * Passinate about X? -> Steard X
* A lead should consider themselves an equal and fill in the gaps of the team when / where needed.

* Transparency builds trust
  * Share the why and the biggest concerns
  * Acknowledge bad situations

* Wrong decisions are better than no decisions
* Create systems / technology to make everyting a Type 2 (reversable) decisions (instead of Type 1 irreversable decisions)

* You cannot will projects into fitting a timeline
* Protect the team from pressure to doers can focus mostly on delivery
* Don't hide behind your leaders: "I'm just doing what I am told"
  * Get to the why from your leaders

* Managing up with honesty
  * Managed expectations
  * Communicate delays and paths forward to manage those delays

* Become a celebration enginge
  * Highlight wins every week
  * Make people feel seen

* A leader is the teammate who shows up to help

* You will always read code more than wrwite it, so make it as readable as possible
  * REFERENCE: [ContextBody](https://github.com/andrey06mi/context-buddy)

* AI increases productivity overall
* As manager, outline what situtations AI is helpful to use (e.g. scaffold controllers vs authentication)
* AI is great at spitting out new lines of code, but not refactoring or beging aware of all archictectual decisoins.
  * Copy paste, duplicdate (not refactor) is favorite pattern of AI
* AI is like a Junior Engineer when it comes to code outputs - must have human in the loop to do refactorings, adhear to code styles, etc.

* **Key takeaways**
  * A leaders must fill in the gaps of their team and level people up so the team can fill the gaps collectively long term.
  * Build systems and technology where everything is a Type 2 reversable decision. This way, folks can try and fail in a safe environment.
  * Celebrate wins every week; it is easy to get lost in the work which leads to burnout.
  * AI is great at outputting code as a Junior level; must have humans / Senior in the loop to make code readable. Optimize for readability as engineers will read code much more often than write code.

### Building SDKs

* Feature flags are very nice to leran safely
* Make the work easier to do
  * If its boring, automate it
* Tests make AI generate code more trustworthly
* Keep domain logic in the centralized backend to keep things scalable - if in the client, then must scale via copy/pasting which is extremely fragile.

* **Key takeaways**
  * Keep domain logic in the domain layer - don't let it creep into the dependent clients. This way, a behavior change in the domain propogates everywhere.

### Making your impact visible

* How am I perceived?
* How do I want to be percieved?
* How do I win friends and influence people?
  * Uplift others?
  * Get to the point?
  * Secure a sponsor?

* "Visibility is part of my career strategy"
  * To get credit, must be visible in the right ways
* What 5 words do you want on your business card? What 5 words do you have on your business card?
  * Look at what people shout you out for to hunt for themese
  * Ask trusted folks for their thoughts

* Check-in Challenge: reflect on list of "I want to be percieved as ..." 10 times
  * On #2 and #9 reflect with a manager to show intent and growth
  * On #6 get a sponsor for 15 minutes to give you feedback

* How to win friends and influence people
  1. Uplift others
      * Must be able to build strong relationships with other people
      * Celebrate others wins
      * Double Kudos: Celebrate people to their managed and the person directly
      * Provide good feedback, make comments actionable and have clear next steps
      * Welcoming Company: Welcome new hires to start building that relationship; sets good foundation for the future
  2. Mentor others
      * Use it to build visibility and be a force multiplier via knowledge transfer / leveling people up
      * Score cards: hiring is hard, score cards help to get on managers radars
  3. Get to the point
      * People are very busy, do bottom line / conclusion upfront
      * Weekly update to manager is most important document for visibility; second is update to stakeholders; third is "I need your impact on ..."

* Secure a sponsor
  * Get somebody to sing your praises in meetings you are not in
  * Help create opportuniites to succeed
    * Get visibility
    * Level up skill

* Extra
  * External visibility
    * Blogs
    * Conferences
  * REFERENCE: [The Staff Engineer's Path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/)
  * REFERENCE: [The Pyramid Principle](https://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-Principle-Logic-Writing-Thinking/dp/1292372265/136-9726324-7375953?psc=1)

* **Key takeaways**
  * Know how people percieve you, how you want to be percieved, and intentionally work to bridge the gap using the Check-in Challenge and the 5 word business card.
  * Building strong working relationships originates from informal social relationships first (strong or week). To influence, build relationships with other people. Celebrate their wins to make them visibile in the right ways, mentor others to become a force multiplier in the organization, and use the "Pyramid Principle" to communicate effectively up, down, and across the organization.

### From friction to focus

* When product engineers falter
  * Delivery slips
  * Quality degrades
  * Morale declines
  * Don't understand / know the why
* Product and engineers have different metrics (e.v. conversions vs cycle time)

* The friction points:
  * Change priorities without tech impact
  * Tech debt deprioritizied
  * Opaque decision-making

* Balanced prioritization: (Tech Sustainability X Business Impact)

|                     |      | Buisness Impact         |                   |
|---------------------|------|-------------------------|-------------------|
|                     |      | Low                     | High              |
| Tech Sustainability | High | :\| -- Over engineering | :D                |
|                     | Low  | :( -- Why even bother?  | :\| -- Trade offs |

* Translate technology concerns into buisness impact (REFERENCE: [Quality Views](https://dev.to/konrad_126/visualizing-technical-debt-with-quality-views-59e7))
  * Tech debt often talks about in feelings, get into business numbers or customer impact
* Did A/B test to look at crash -> cancel impact to quanitfy crash vs new feature development in $$$
  * Intentionally would 5xx the site to empirically measure cancel rate
* Present "Cost of delay" but not doing this tech debt work

* Unite with metrics
  * Retention <-> Reliability
  * Conversation <-> Performance
  * Time-to-market <-> Defact rate

* Practices for partnership between leads and product owner
  * Demand engineer voice in decision making process -> Invite yourself
    * Get foot in the door by asking to just be a fly on the wall of meetings; being present often leads to people seeking your input
  * Regular alignment rituals (talk to product)
    * Create strong working relationships
  * Transparency in trade-offs
    * Inside and outside the team
  * Mutual trust and coverage
  * Psychological safety
    * If can't solve, escalate immediately until it can be solved
    * Very expensive to company if not solved
  * Leaders model effective partnership to rest of team

* **Key takeaways**
  * Product Owners and Engineers often live in two different worlds. POs focus on adoption, customer flows, and customer converation rates / iterations. Engineers focus on time-to-delivery, site reliability, and defects. While PO metrics are easier to quantify in $$$ while engineering metrics are often communicated as idoloigcal versus any real buisness impact. But, a 5xx response indirectly impacts $$$, but the question is how much? Find ways to quantify technical debt in terms of $$$ to get it prioritized.
  * Strive not to over engineer or create trade-offs to deliver features with low tech sustainability. Strive to stay in the Goldilocks Zone: High Sustainability and High Buisness impact by baking quality into the practicies and expectations from the start.

### The uncomfortable middle
