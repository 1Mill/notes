## Key Takeaways

* TODO

## Notes

* Reading your system
* Hiearchy is an optimization from the bottom up (REFERENCE: Thinking in Systems)

### All things I misunderstood about being a leader

* Leadership is about building frameworks for success - not control
* Create space and boundries for teams to have great ideas.
* People must be bought in, so hunt for missionaries, not mercenernies.
  * As lead, your ideas are HIPPO ideas
* "What do you want me to deprioritize to focus on this?" - quite to build alignment with stakeholders / bosses
* Leaders define outcomes, not solutions
* Leaders should spend most of their time not changing priorities, teams need time to execute

* Teams must get it to delivery effectively: Clarity, Stability, Confidence.
* "How often does my roadmap not change?"
* Hold roadmap for 90 days to 6 months ideally.

* Leaders want to wait to gather more information lead to passionate ideas getting dropped
  * "Let's revisit next week" is the phrase that kills passion / motiviation

* Advice process
  1. Ask for feedback
  2. Set deadline
  3. Act

* You learn more by shipping the wrong thing that trying to debate what the right thing might be
  * Real customer feedback is better than hypothetical feedback
* Learn fast by making failure safe.

* Helocopter parenter prevents opportunities for growth -> Let people learn by doing
* Don't be a martyre by compensating for people's lack of capability -> level folks up
  * Address issues now, don't let them linger
* "I think you are capable of X, but ... level up"

* Process outlines desire path, it shouldn't become the work itself; process is not the point.
* Metrics must align / impact outcomes, otherwise people get distracted with busy work which doesn't relate / drive profitability.

* Power is what bad leaders leverage when tey can't earn trust or respect
* Leadership is not an individual persuit, it requires community / others
  * You are on the team, not above the team

* **Key takeaways**
  * Leadership is not something you do solo, it requires community / others to want to follow. When authority must be used to force follows, then it means there is a breakdown in clarity, stability, and/or confdence in the leaders.
  * Leaders often build systems to contro. Instead, the mission of a leader should be to build systems which level people up (i.e. build organizational capabilities) while delivering profitable work. This dual mandate requires leaders to build focus so teams can execute effectively and create the space for people to learn and fail safely while doing the work. Learning through doing is the best feedback.

### No one left behind

* Critical to know your team
  * Who can work under what situtations?
  * How do they burn out?
* Let people choose their own paths
  * Passinate about X? -> Steard X
* A lead should consider themselves an equal and fill in the gaps of the team when / where needed.

* Transparency builds trust
  * Share the why and the biggest concerns
  * Acknowledge bad situations

* Wrong decisions are better than no decisions
* Create systems / technology to make everyting a Type 2 (reversable) decisions (instead of Type 1 irreversable decisions)

* You cannot will projects into fitting a timeline
* Protect the team from pressure to doers can focus mostly on delivery
* Don't hide behind your leaders: "I'm just doing what I am told"
  * Get to the why from your leaders

* Managing up with honesty
  * Managed expectations
  * Communicate delays and paths forward to manage those delays

* Become a celebration enginge
  * Highlight wins every week
  * Make people feel seen

* A leader is the teammate who shows up to help

* You will always read code more than wrwite it, so make it as readable as possible
  * REFERENCE: [ContextBody](https://github.com/andrey06mi/context-buddy)

* AI increases productivity overall
* As manager, outline what situtations AI is helpful to use (e.g. scaffold controllers vs authentication)
* AI is great at spitting out new lines of code, but not refactoring or beging aware of all archictectual decisoins.
  * Copy paste, duplicdate (not refactor) is favorite pattern of AI
* AI is like a Junior Engineer when it comes to code outputs - must have human in the loop to do refactorings, adhear to code styles, etc.

* **Key takeaways**
  * A leaders must fill in the gaps of their team and level people up so the team can fill the gaps collectively long term.
  * Build systems and technology where everything is a Type 2 reversable decision. This way, folks can try and fail in a safe environment.
  * Celebrate wins every week; it is easy to get lost in the work which leads to burnout.
  * AI is great at outputting code as a Junior level; must have humans / Senior in the loop to make code readable. Optimize for readability as engineers will read code much more often than write code.

### Building SDKs

* Feature flags are very nice to leran safely
* Make the work easier to do
  * If its boring, automate it
* Tests make AI generate code more trustworthly
* Keep domain logic in the centralized backend to keep things scalable - if in the client, then must scale via copy/pasting which is extremely fragile.

* **Key takeaways**
  * Keep domain logic in the domain layer - don't let it creep into the dependent clients. This way, a behavior change in the domain propogates everywhere.

### Making your impact visible

* How am I perceived?
* How do I want to be percieved?
* How do I win friends and influence people?
  * Uplift others?
  * Get to the point?
  * Secure a sponsor?

* "Visibility is part of my career strategy"
  * To get credit, must be visible in the right ways
* What 5 words do you want on your business card? What 5 words do you have on your business card?
  * Look at what people shout you out for to hunt for themese
  * Ask trusted folks for their thoughts

* Check-in Challenge: reflect on list of "I want to be percieved as ..." 10 times
  * On #2 and #9 reflect with a manager to show intent and growth
  * On #6 get a sponsor for 15 minutes to give you feedback

* How to win friends and influence people
  1. Uplift others
      * Must be able to build strong relationships with other people
      * Celebrate others wins
      * Double Kudos: Celebrate people to their managed and the person directly
      * Provide good feedback, make comments actionable and have clear next steps
      * Welcoming Company: Welcome new hires to start building that relationship; sets good foundation for the future
  2. Mentor others
      * Use it to build visibility and be a force multiplier via knowledge transfer / leveling people up
      * Score cards: hiring is hard, score cards help to get on managers radars
  3. Get to the point
      * People are very busy, do bottom line / conclusion upfront
      * Weekly update to manager is most important document for visibility; second is update to stakeholders; third is "I need your impact on ..."

* Secure a sponsor
  * Get somebody to sing your praises in meetings you are not in
  * Help create opportuniites to succeed
    * Get visibility
    * Level up skill

* Extra
  * External visibility
    * Blogs
    * Conferences
  * REFERENCE: [The Staff Engineer's Path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/)
  * REFERENCE: [The Pyramid Principle](https://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-Principle-Logic-Writing-Thinking/dp/1292372265/136-9726324-7375953?psc=1)

* **Key takeaways**
  * Know how people percieve you, how you want to be percieved, and intentionally work to bridge the gap using the Check-in Challenge and the 5 word business card.
  * Building strong working relationships originates from informal social relationships first (strong or week). To influence, build relationships with other people. Celebrate their wins to make them visibile in the right ways, mentor others to become a force multiplier in the organization, and use the "Pyramid Principle" to communicate effectively up, down, and across the organization.

### From friction to focus

* When product engineers falter
  * Delivery slips
  * Quality degrades
  * Morale declines
  * Don't understand / know the why
* Product and engineers have different metrics (e.v. conversions vs cycle time)

* The friction points:
  * Change priorities without tech impact
  * Tech debt deprioritizied
  * Opaque decision-making

* Balanced prioritization: (Tech Sustainability X Business Impact)

|                     |      | Buisness Impact         |                   |
|---------------------|------|-------------------------|-------------------|
|                     |      | Low                     | High              |
| Tech Sustainability | High | :\| -- Over engineering | :D                |
|                     | Low  | :( -- Why even bother?  | :\| -- Trade offs |

* Translate technology concerns into buisness impact (REFERENCE: [Quality Views](https://dev.to/konrad_126/visualizing-technical-debt-with-quality-views-59e7))
  * Tech debt often talks about in feelings, get into business numbers or customer impact
* Did A/B test to look at crash -> cancel impact to quanitfy crash vs new feature development in $$$
  * Intentionally would 5xx the site to empirically measure cancel rate
* Present "Cost of delay" but not doing this tech debt work

* Unite with metrics
  * Retention <-> Reliability
  * Conversation <-> Performance
  * Time-to-market <-> Defact rate

* Practices for partnership between leads and product owner
  * Demand engineer voice in decision making process -> Invite yourself
    * Get foot in the door by asking to just be a fly on the wall of meetings; being present often leads to people seeking your input
  * Regular alignment rituals (talk to product)
    * Create strong working relationships
  * Transparency in trade-offs
    * Inside and outside the team
  * Mutual trust and coverage
  * Psychological safety
    * If can't solve, escalate immediately until it can be solved
    * Very expensive to company if not solved
  * Leaders model effective partnership to rest of team

* **Key takeaways**
  * Product Owners and Engineers often live in two different worlds. POs focus on adoption, customer flows, and customer converation rates / iterations. Engineers focus on time-to-delivery, site reliability, and defects. While PO metrics are easier to quantify in $$$ while engineering metrics are often communicated as idoloigcal versus any real buisness impact. But, a 5xx response indirectly impacts $$$, but the question is how much? Find ways to quantify technical debt in terms of $$$ to get it prioritized.
  * Strive not to over engineer or create trade-offs to deliver features with low tech sustainability. Strive to stay in the Goldilocks Zone: High Sustainability and High Buisness impact by baking quality into the practicies and expectations from the start.

### The uncomfortable middle

* Cultivating morale
  * Frame opportunity, challenge, and uncertainty with equal honesty
  * Don't be afraid to say "I don't know"
  * Hoonesty better than toxic positivity
* Foster team growth
  * Balance high expectations with high empathy
  * Expectations without empathy is a path to turn out and toxic culture
  * Empathy without expectations leads to stagnation
* Growing your leaders
  * Self-doubt is very human
  * Listen to what people are saying

* **Key takeaways**
  * As a leaders who wants to level up others: be honest, set high expectations, and have high empathy to work with people to grow towards those expectations.

### Plugging into power

* Power is what gives access
* Everybody has power, often people don't think they have power

* About systems:
  1. Systems run on power
  2. The purpose of a system is what it does
  3. Systems express their values through their budgets

* Institutions have power; people lend their power to institutions.
* System are had to see, but budgets make it visible.

* What systems lend power to people?

* Burnout is accrued through moral injury, not long hours.
  * Power missued by institutions.

* "I need power" -> Fight the system
* "We need power" -> Change the system itself

* **Key takeaways**
  * All the above.

### Random - Day 1

* REFERENCE: [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321)
* Essential characteristics
  1. Strategic vision, Risk Navigator: Understand business impact, navigate oportunities, and risk. Champion ethical ecisoin-making and data gonverence.
  2. Cultured catelyst, Empowering
  3. ______

### Predictable is better than fast

* Cost of delay has cascading effects
  * Marketing, sales, and other downstream dependent teams
  * Cut corners, cut quality
  * Constant conversations about alignment / priorities
* Cost of early is the same as delayed - particularly with downstream dependencies.

* Use AI to enhance productivity, not eliminate teams in the delivery process

* Projects have required due date, but not required sub-tasks - scope is always negotiable.
* Team / ___ normalize noise in vaiance in the team itself (i.e. working collectively produces stable velocity so that feature A is not strongly dependent on person A not being sick)

* **Key takeaways**
  * Like heiarchy in physics, when looking at teams in aggregate individual variance is cancelled out to create a stable velocity. With this stable velocity, downstream teams can depend on the team so that higher order functions can occure with the organization. For this reason, stability and predictability are team characteristics teams leaders should strive for while continuing to level up in qualty internally.

### Find the spark

* Not everybody seeks promotion, but everybody must grow
  * Teams that grow together, succeed together
  * Continous learning keeps people interested
  * Personal development is key to job satisfaction in this highly competitive market

* REFERENCE: [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/)

* High performance profiles
  * Rock star: steady grow, stability, need to see / feel important
  * Super star: rapid growth, enjoys change
* Medium performers:
  * Meet expectations
  * May rely on high performers
  * Risk of plateauing, not seeking next level
  * Have conversations every 6 months to reevaluate growth goals
* Low performers
  * Growth potential: Misaligned role or ___, need coaching
  * No potential: Poor quality work, no sign of improvement, hold team back -> Must be transfered off team (move to another team or lay off)

* People can grow technically and non-technically (e.g. soft skills):
  * Colaboration
  * Communicatoin
  * Leadership
  * ...

* Promotions require a buisness case and is influenced by many factors (e.g. budgets)
* Growth is cultural whereas promotions are structural
* 4 level of motivation:
  1. Purpose - Connect to the mission / inpact
  2. Progress - Make milestones visible
  3. Mastery - New skills and/or new challenges
  4. Flexibility - Control over time and work style (e.g. working hours, siloed vs pair programming)

* **Key takeaways**
  * Promotions require a buisness case while growing / leveling up is cultural; create environments where people are continously growing so when promotions make business sense those folks are ready.
  * Figure out who on the team falls into which performance profile: rock stars, super stars, medium performers, growth potential, or no potential; and figure out what motivates them: purpose, progress, mastery, and/or flexibility.

### Pay your (conflict) debt on time

* Conflict is only harmful when left unresolved, ___, or  unacknowledged.
* REFERENCE: [The Good Fight](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Fight-Productive-Conflict-Organization/dp/198902520X)

* Debt is unresolved conflicts (e.g. no strategic advantage)
* Debt gains interest, turning conversations into confrontations
* Costs materialize in constant meetings, working around people, lack of trust, and wasted effort
  * Pushes misalignment underground because people can not effectively talk to one another

* Conflict ___: Natural discomfort, but addresses conflict.
* Conflict Avoidance: Never surfaces disagreement, defer conflict until they explode.

* Architypes:
  * Unproductive
    * Side Stepper: Deflect, delay, disappear
    * Peacemaker: People pleasuer, avoid hard truths
    * Bulldog: All-or-nothing, deminated conversations
    * Sycophant: Exclude people, ___ conversations
  * Productive
    * Engager: Learn into it
    * Truth Teller: Constructive candor
    * Challenger: Direct, flexible
    * Connector: Transparent, inclusive

* Conflict avoident often ...
  * Recurring same conflict
  * Low trust
  * Echo chambers

* Non-violent communication (NVC)
  * Balance honesty vs empathy
  * Discvoer unmeet needs
  * Clear without being crule
* Steps for NVC
  1. Observe behavior
  2. Reflect on feel
  3. Discover needs
  4. Make a constructive request
* Recognize -> Practice -> Influence

* **Key takeaways**
  * Conflict is only harmful when left unresolved or unacknowledged. Learn to recognize where conflict falls into one of these categories (e.g. working around people, recurring issues) and practice how to communicate it effectively to influence change. Use the NVC to keep the conversation productive.

### Effective cross team

* Staff+ guild that reviewes all relevant ADRs / RFCs
* If team working without a sponsor, then assign + bubble up to Staff+ guild

### Learning

* Dedicated time, must give back
  * Presentation
  * Adoption
  * Spike
* Everybody has capability to grow in some capacity

### The magic of crisis

* As a Staff+, never think out load as people will think your half-baked idea is the full plan

* "Nothing ever changes until there is a crisis"
* "Never let a good crsis go to waste" -> During a crisis people become more willing to change as the current way is obviously failing

* Global configuration changes frequently cause outages.

* Types of crisis
  1. Fundemental suprise
      * AWS outage turned off service and office lights
      * New place, new rules to learn
  2. Broken core functionality
      * Change is not optional
  3. High visibility
      * News reporter calling about X
      * Percieved as blocking progress
  4. Perception breakdown
      * Alert overload, information non-actionable
      * "It works on my machine"
      * Collapse in sense making, fog of war
  5. Rigid timing
      * Deadlines with real consequences (e.g. API will expire in 30 days; not made up ones from product)
      * Force to improve collaboration / process (i.e. a lot of process / "waste" is suddently eliminated)

* Crisis as an Opportunity (CaaO)
  * Shifted incentives
  * Inverted or diverted power structures
  * Radically altered priorities
  * Radically altered communication structures

* Practical > Ideological (MVP > Perfect)
* Ask for capacity for more robust solutions

* Not crises
  * Missed deadlines
  * Budget overruns
  * Technical debt
  * Bad UX for customers
  * Feeling of impending doom is not a crisis (yet)
  * Manufactured crises (e.g. deadlines from product)

* Be patient, be ready for 3 of 5 crisis types
* REFERENCE: [Crisis Engineering](https://www.amazon.com/Crisis-Engineering-Time-Tested-Turning-Clarity/dp/0306836866)

* **Key takeaways**
  * Crisis are an opportunity to impart change as incentives, structures, and priorities have drastically shifted. Fix the immediate crisis and then leverage that win to get leadership bought into those long-term fixes which have been in the backlog.

### Tackling technical debt

* Technical debt ...
  * Makes code difficult to understand
  * Makes code difficult to scale
  * Makes code difficult to change
* Knowing interested on debt is very important
* Easy to look at old code and think they were dumb ("misattribution error" from psychology)

* Developer Experience (DX) Factors negatively impacted by technical debt:
  * Flow state
  * Cognitive load
  * Feedback loops

* Technical debt -> Hard to test / verify -> Frequent incidents

* How to deal with tech debt:
  1. Visulize the problem (e.g. DORA metrics)
  2. Benchmark against industry (e.g. DORA us vs them)
  3. Evangelize and Explain
  4. Secure some capacity (e.g. 50%, 20%, ..., capacity)
  5. Deliver, deliver, deliver
      * Slice & Dice, Strangle pattern
      * Make the work visible
      * Make the risk visible
      * Observability

* Rewrite always takes longer than expected; don't dedicate 100% capacity - may kill company.

* Feedback Loops: Add tests
* Cognitive load: [CRAP Measure](https://dx42.github.io/gmetrics/metrics/CrapMetric.html)
* Flow: Documentation

* Start with tech debt improvements before a settling on a rewrite
* Put an expire date for hacks
* Leave things better than you found it
* Make space in capacity for improvement
* Sometimes have to put foot down as lead to prioritize tech debt (be a stuborn, loud swan vs ?track)

* **Key takeaways**
  * Technical debt negatively impacts the Developer Experience (DX) and also makes software more expensive to change. Technical debt makes code difficult to reason through which makes code more difficult to test which results in more production incidents. To drive down technical debt, carve out capacity (e.g. 20%) to pay down this debt in tiny slices.
  * Rewriting products is a huge investment which always takes longer than you think which may kill the buisness. Always always always try tackling technical debt before trying to rewrite from scratch.

### Leading without committing

* How to lead without being a direct contributor / writing code (i.e. committing)

1. Identify + fill blind spots
    * Admin what you don't know
    * Mirror language team already uses; make glossary for product
    * Become expert in big picture
    * Build relationships to get feedback about gaps lack of technical and domain knowledge (i.e. leverage ICs)
2. Build trust
    * Establish credibility
    * Shadow engineering doing the work
3. Leverage what you do know
    * Fundementals > Syntax
      * Observability
      * Performance
      * Scaling
    * Identify opportunities for folks to grow ownership
4. Manage down to manage up
    * Teach managing up
    * Understand + develop career goals
    * Shared 1:1 notes
    * They set and articulate tech plans

* **Key takeaways**
  * Going into the management track at traditional organizations you will be writing less and less code which you will have less and less domain or technical knowledge in organizations you are supposed to be a leading in. Become an expert in the big picture, leverage your knowledge of the fundementals (e.g. ovservability, scalability) and build strong working relationships with technology leaders (i.e. Senior+ ICs) to help turn the big picture into working software.

### Beyond the code

* Culture
  * Values: Shared understanding / mission
  * Belief: Leadership approach
  * Attitude: ???
  * Behavior: How people interact
  * Practices: Rituals (e.g. standup)

* People collaborate more effectively the more overlap in culture they share
* Culture scales easier than practicies.

* Make sure culture interview questions have a scorecard as people in the same company often measure / observe culture differently

* Spread cultural questions throughout the interview by asking "Why" and deeper questions during the other interview ___ to uncover their principles, practicies, etc.

* Make culture transparent and public so people can self-select out early

* Assessment criteria
  1. What are you looking for?
  2. What value does it align with?
  3. Where does this person rate on that value / principle (e.g. Likert-like Scale)?

* **Key takeaways**
  * Culture scales where practicies plateau. Practicies are too context dependent. What may work for one team in one context may not work for a different team in a different context. Don't be dogmatic. Instead, scale culture. Culture is the mindset which shapes practice.
  * Culture fit is a big factor for effective collaboration. Make your culture public and hunt for good culture fits throughout the entire interview process: not just the last question.

### Estimates are a waste of time

* TODO
