## Key Takaways

- TODO

## Notes

- Agile Safari: Join a company for half a day to see if prospective employee is a good fit.
  - Usually best with team programming to see how they fit and interact with the team.
  - They do this at Hunter Industries
- Being remote-first makes it easier to recruit people from across the globe.
  - Just need to figure out the timezone situtation.
- Hunter industries now only does half day team programming versus full day, perhaps because of Zoom fatigue or something else.
- How to make daily SCRUM meetings fresh
  - Stop doing the three questions: ask "How are we doing at advancing towards our sprint goal?"
  - Don't talk about each item, just talk about where we are with respect to our goal
  - Daily meetings are a good opportunity to ask for help, but not to dig into details or conversations unless it actively invovles the whole team.
  - Enforce timebox to keep the meeting going
  - ABCD Method: Announcements, Blockers, C\_, Dates
  - People are usually not actively engaged because they are thinking about that they are going to say
  - "Where did we say we wanted to be in 2 weeks and where are we at today?"
  - Focus on "we" not "I"
  - Walking through the board is time consuming
  - Queue up topics from standup and use LEAN Coffee to have meaningful and engaged conversations / breakouts.
- Using GPT

  - Success using it for writing job descriptions
  - Success for writing emails, announcements, etc. especially for editorial suggestions on a rough draft.
  - Succesds in asking it for patterns from daily announcements, etc.
  - Chat GPT and CoPilot uses private or not opened source code as a reference, so legal fears of using generated code.

- Failure to Communicate
  - Reference / Facilitator: Woody Zuill
    - How can I introduce change in a place where I am just an engineer?
    - Why do we have teams?
    - These questions lead to discovery of mob / team programming
    - Reference: [Wiio's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiio%27s_laws)
      - <https://jkorpela.fi/wiio.html>
      - Communication usually fails except by accident
      - ...
  - Toast masters teach that people and hear through filters and those filters are built through their unique experiences.
    - Every reciever interprets everything differently based on their own experiences / huristics.
  - People have differnt personas based on the role and psychological saftey they have with the people around them
  - Compartmentalization makes solving root issues more difficult
  - Reference: Dave Gray
    - My truth is not your truth
  - Sometime communication is left ambigious so that people can operaete in a gray area.
  - The more communication appears to suceeds the more it is failing
  - People must feel safe to effectively communicate
  - Reference: <https://bibliothequer.com/social/functional-stupidity-and-its-consequences-for-organizations/>
  - We bring our own biases into everything we learn and hear
  - Try to verify communication by asking for people clarity
  - Team programming makes validating communication intent immediate
  - Team programming makes communication alignment obvious
  - Some people are not verbal processors so using chat to think through their response can also help include more people into the conversations
  - How people are primed changes how people perceive and interpret communications
