## Key Takaways

- TODO

## Notes

- Agile Safari: Join a company for half a day to see if prospective employee is a good fit.
  - Usually best with team programming to see how they fit and interact with the team.
  - They do this at Hunter Industries
- Being remote-first makes it easier to recruit people from across the globe.
  - Just need to figure out the timezone situtation.
- Hunter industries now only does half day team programming versus full day, perhaps because of Zoom fatigue or something else.
- How to make daily SCRUM meetings fresh
  - Stop doing the three questions: ask "How are we doing at advancing towards our sprint goal?"
  - Don't talk about each item, just talk about where we are with respect to our goal
  - Daily meetings are a good opportunity to ask for help, but not to dig into details or conversations unless it actively invovles the whole team.
  - Enforce timebox to keep the meeting going
  - ABCD Method: Announcements, Blockers, C\_, Dates
  - People are usually not actively engaged because they are thinking about that they are going to say
  - "Where did we say we wanted to be in 2 weeks and where are we at today?"
  - Focus on "we" not "I"
  - Walking through the board is time consuming
  - Queue up topics from standup and use LEAN Coffee to have meaningful and engaged conversations / breakouts.
- Using GPT
  - Success using it for writing job descriptions
  - Success for writing emails, announcements, etc. especially for editorial suggestions on a rough draft.
  - Succesds in asking it for patterns from daily announcements, etc.
  - Chat GPT and CoPilot uses private or not opened source code as a reference, so legal fears of using generated code.
