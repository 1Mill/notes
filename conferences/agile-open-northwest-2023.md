## Key Takaways

- TODO

## Notes

### Day 1

- Agile Safari: Join a company for half a day to see if prospective employee is a good fit.
  - Usually best with team programming to see how they fit and interact with the team.
  - They do this at Hunter Industries
- Being remote-first makes it easier to recruit people from across the globe.
  - Just need to figure out the timezone situtation.
- Hunter industries now only does half day team programming versus full day, perhaps because of Zoom fatigue or something else.
- How to make daily SCRUM meetings fresh
  - Stop doing the three questions: ask "How are we doing at advancing towards our sprint goal?"
  - Don't talk about each item, just talk about where we are with respect to our goal
  - Daily meetings are a good opportunity to ask for help, but not to dig into details or conversations unless it actively invovles the whole team.
  - Enforce timebox to keep the meeting going
  - ABCD Method: Announcements, Blockers, C\_, Dates
  - People are usually not actively engaged because they are thinking about that they are going to say
  - "Where did we say we wanted to be in 2 weeks and where are we at today?"
  - Focus on "we" not "I"
  - Walking through the board is time consuming
  - Queue up topics from standup and use LEAN Coffee to have meaningful and engaged conversations / breakouts.
- Using GPT

  - Success using it for writing job descriptions
  - Success for writing emails, announcements, etc. especially for editorial suggestions on a rough draft.
  - Succesds in asking it for patterns from daily announcements, etc.
  - Chat GPT and CoPilot uses private or not opened source code as a reference, so legal fears of using generated code.

- Failure to Communicate

  - Reference / Facilitator: Woody Zuill
    - How can I introduce change in a place where I am just an engineer?
    - Why do we have teams?
    - These questions lead to discovery of mob / team programming
    - Reference: [Wiio's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiio%27s_laws)
      - <https://jkorpela.fi/wiio.html>
      - Communication usually fails except by accident
      - ...
  - Toast masters teach that people and hear through filters and those filters are built through their unique experiences.
    - Every reciever interprets everything differently based on their own experiences / huristics.
  - People have differnt personas based on the role and psychological saftey they have with the people around them
  - Compartmentalization makes solving root issues more difficult
  - Reference: Dave Gray
    - My truth is not your truth
  - Sometime communication is left ambigious so that people can operaete in a gray area.
  - The more communication appears to suceeds the more it is failing
  - People must feel safe to effectively communicate
  - Reference: <https://bibliothequer.com/social/functional-stupidity-and-its-consequences-for-organizations/>
  - We bring our own biases into everything we learn and hear
  - Try to verify communication by asking for people clarity
  - Team programming makes validating communication intent immediate
  - Team programming makes communication alignment obvious
  - Some people are not verbal processors so using chat to think through their response can also help include more people into the conversations
  - How people are primed changes how people perceive and interpret communications

- Product Roadmap Maturity Model

  - Levels of maturity
    - Level 1: Reactive Work and One-Off Solutions
      - Work is identified based on the direct needs of your customers
      - Solutions are delivered in a non-reusable way that is customized solely for that customer/need
    - Level 2: Reactive Features and Reusable Solutions
      - Features are identified based on the direct needs of your customers
      - Solutions are built in a reusable way that allows any future customer with a similar need to be implemented without additional investment
    - Level 3: Proactive Features and Cohesive Solutions
      - Features are identified based on a desire to build a product the meets the needs of an identified target market and/or ideal customer
      - NOT based only/directly on current customers and existing needs (although these should be considered).
      - Solutions are built in a way that pulls the entire product towards the identified target market / ideal customer
    - Level 4: Market Leading
    - Level 5: Market Creation
  - Technology must be an equal partner at the stakeholder level.
  - Vendors lead with a lot of promises and usually have a lot of hidden costs
    - What is the usually hidden cost to manage a vendor?

- Refreshing the Coding Dogo for Remote

  - <https://ted.dev/articles/2022/01/15/remote-learning-ensembles/>
  - Try and "discuss in code" versus just disussing on the abstract
  - Learn non-judgemental self-observation
  - Sparrow Deck to help identify code smalls, etc.
    - <https://llewellynfalco.blogspot.com/p/sparrow-decks.html>
  - Find opportunities for refactoring within your own code base: not fake code.
  - Work with peole on frequent small batches (e.g. 3 hours a week every Monday) versus infrequent intese session (e.g. 1 week every year)
  - Start simple
  - Demonstrate or ask for wrong ways to solve a problem to kick off conversations
  - Think about the code critically together
  - The intent is to build
    - A way to review code without being judgemental about it
    - Get on the same page about terms
  - You have to let people make mistakes so that they can learn
  - Timezones make it difficult to find shared learning time
    - Solve by making "focus time" on shared blocks
    - Solve by employing dynamic reteaming to not try and control when people can and cannot work - let people work and form teams when they are avalibile.
      - Term: Liquid Mobs
  - How do you get buy in from management to get learning / improvements hours?
    - Go bottom up and get short sessions going with peers - only through experiencing it do people see the value.
    - Introduce in high safty environments where they are working on non-product related stuff versus low saftey environments which is must-have product work done.
      - People started incorporating things they learned into the lower saftey environments.
  - Power structures interfere with productive / efficient ways of working
  - Prove out efficiencny of change by doing in small team specific changes - not by prophisizing
  - Book: Coaching for Learning
  - It is impossible to guague learning, attention, etc. without a camera. People must feel comfortable and safe to have their cameras on.
  - Retro frequently - such as 2 times per day during learning sessions

- Simulating Scaled Agile

  - Kanban Drivers Edition - a boardgame to simulate ways of working

- Cross cultural agile

  - Different cultures have different ways of working which causes miscommunication
    - Solve through ad-hoc demos frequently to verify communication was truely successful
    - Solve through 1-1 conversations
  - Learn to understand and adjust ways of working to different cultures

- Escaping the Agile Industrial Complex

  - People with credentials use those credentials as an authority to do non-agie things.
  - Management believes "doing agile" is at the individual contributor level, not the management level.
  - Businesses care about
    - Direct Value - money
    - Learning Value - know we know
    - Option Value - we have options we didn't have before
  - Companies hire people with credentials to reduce percieved risk
  - Build working relationships at the team level and then work your way up the organization
  - Being agile is a cultural missison which means all levels of the organization must be bought in - particularly C-Suite
  - Not every part of an organization must be adaptive - but making the parts that should be adaptive be adaptive makes adapting to changes in the market much eaiser
  - Right sizing of agile transformation: what level are you being brought into and what area of influence do you have?
    - Who is trying to lead the agile transformation within the company and what level of influence is being given? Sometimes, it is just making a few teams better.
  - Build repor so that making change is eaiser
  - Help teams realize where flow is not being achieved

- Techincal debt

  - Is it an overloaded term?
  - Code quality is a snapshot in time and that definition can change over time making old previously prestine code no longer prestine code.
  - Technical Dirt: teams rushing too fast without concern for quality
  - Technical Debt Quadrant: <https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html>

- Psychological Saftey Intro

  - Levels
    1. Saftey to act
       - "When we feel save enough and say we have a problem here"
    2. Saftey to be
       - Do we feel safe in this environment, less about behavior
    3. Saftey is a state where we have access to our rational thinking
       - If we do not feel psychologically safe we do not have access full and total access to all our thinking power
  - Two survival mechanisms
    - Freeze response is our oldest survival instinct which inhibits oxegyn to the prefrontal cortext
    - Flight or Fight is the rapid movement response which stops pushing engergy to all non-essential services - we need to react not think
  - What (in theory) can we do to get higher levels of productivity? SAFTEY model
    - Security
      - Predict what is coming next in our environment - consistency, committment, certainty, no change
      - Teams have a regulare routine
    - Autonomy
      - Need to have control over our environment and have choises
      - People cannot have autonomy without security
    - Fairness
      - Our need to engage in and experience fair exchanges to us and others
    - Esteem
      - Our need to be highly regarded
      - Don't want to get kicked out
    - Trust
      - Our social need to belong and protect our group
    - You
      - Unique factors to yourself like personality, bias, etc.

- Software Teaming

  - New name for mob programming
  - Mob with non-enigneers doing simple examples like FizzBuzz to help learn how the process works
  - Co-locating mobbing pre COVID: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVqUcNKVbYg>
  - Start learning how to mob by tackling a small function nobody likes
  - Strong Style Pairing: "For an idea to go from your head into the computer it must go through someone else's hands."
  - People naturally mob during high stress situations like an outage because fast and clear communication is so critical. However, why do people not fast and clear communication during less stressful situations?
  - Group memory is better than individual memory which help make context switching easier and faster.
  - When mobbing, the absense of one person is minimized on the work flow. With solo work, the work completely stops.
  - Mobbing only works with psychological saftey.

- Closing Circle
  - Do not attribute to a person a trait that can be attributed to a company's culture.
  - To support self-organization you need a container.
