## Key Takaways

- TODO

## Notes

- Agile Safari: Join a company for half a day to see if prospective employee is a good fit.
  - Usually best with team programming to see how they fit and interact with the team.
  - They do this at Hunter Industries
- Being remote-first makes it easier to recruit people from across the globe.
  - Just need to figure out the timezone situtation.
- Hunter industries now only does half day team programming versus full day, perhaps because of Zoom fatigue or something else.
- How to make daily SCRUM meetings fresh
  - Stop doing the three questions: ask "How are we doing at advancing towards our sprint goal?"
  - Don't talk about each item, just talk about where we are with respect to our goal
  - Daily meetings are a good opportunity to ask for help, but not to dig into details or conversations unless it actively invovles the whole team.
  - Enforce timebox to keep the meeting going
  - ABCD Method: Announcements, Blockers, C\_, Dates
  - People are usually not actively engaged because they are thinking about that they are going to say
  - "Where did we say we wanted to be in 2 weeks and where are we at today?"
  - Focus on "we" not "I"
  - Walking through the board is time consuming
  - Queue up topics from standup and use LEAN Coffee to have meaningful and engaged conversations / breakouts.
- Using GPT

  - Success using it for writing job descriptions
  - Success for writing emails, announcements, etc. especially for editorial suggestions on a rough draft.
  - Succesds in asking it for patterns from daily announcements, etc.
  - Chat GPT and CoPilot uses private or not opened source code as a reference, so legal fears of using generated code.

- Failure to Communicate

  - Reference / Facilitator: Woody Zuill
    - How can I introduce change in a place where I am just an engineer?
    - Why do we have teams?
    - These questions lead to discovery of mob / team programming
    - Reference: [Wiio's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiio%27s_laws)
      - <https://jkorpela.fi/wiio.html>
      - Communication usually fails except by accident
      - ...
  - Toast masters teach that people and hear through filters and those filters are built through their unique experiences.
    - Every reciever interprets everything differently based on their own experiences / huristics.
  - People have differnt personas based on the role and psychological saftey they have with the people around them
  - Compartmentalization makes solving root issues more difficult
  - Reference: Dave Gray
    - My truth is not your truth
  - Sometime communication is left ambigious so that people can operaete in a gray area.
  - The more communication appears to suceeds the more it is failing
  - People must feel safe to effectively communicate
  - Reference: <https://bibliothequer.com/social/functional-stupidity-and-its-consequences-for-organizations/>
  - We bring our own biases into everything we learn and hear
  - Try to verify communication by asking for people clarity
  - Team programming makes validating communication intent immediate
  - Team programming makes communication alignment obvious
  - Some people are not verbal processors so using chat to think through their response can also help include more people into the conversations
  - How people are primed changes how people perceive and interpret communications

- Product Roadmap Maturity Model

  - Levels of maturity
    - Level 1: Reactive Work and One-Off Solutions
      - Work is identified based on the direct needs of your customers
      - Solutions are delivered in a non-reusable way that is customized solely for that customer/need
    - Level 2: Reactive Features and Reusable Solutions
      - Features are identified based on the direct needs of your customers
      - Solutions are built in a reusable way that allows any future customer with a similar need to be implemented without additional investment
    - Level 3: Proactive Features and Cohesive Solutions
      - Features are identified based on a desire to build a product the meets the needs of an identified target market and/or ideal customer
      - NOT based only/directly on current customers and existing needs (although these should be considered).
      - Solutions are built in a way that pulls the entire product towards the identified target market / ideal customer
    - Level 4: Market Leading
    - Level 5: Market Creation
  - Technology must be an equal partner at the stakeholder level.
  - Vendors lead with a lot of promises and usually have a lot of hidden costs
    - What is the usually hidden cost to manage a vendor?

- Refreshing the Coding Dogo for Remote

  - <https://ted.dev/articles/2022/01/15/remote-learning-ensembles/>
  - Try and "discuss in code" versus just disussing on the abstract
  - Learn non-judgemental self-observation
  - Sparrow Deck to help identify code smalls, etc.
    - <https://llewellynfalco.blogspot.com/p/sparrow-decks.html>
  - Find opportunities for refactoring within your own code base: not fake code.
  - Work with peole on frequent small batches (e.g. 3 hours a week every Monday) versus infrequent intese session (e.g. 1 week every year)
  - Start simple
  - Demonstrate or ask for wrong ways to solve a problem to kick off conversations
  - Think about the code critically together
  - The intent is to build
    - A way to review code without being judgemental about it
    - Get on the same page about terms
  - You have to let people make mistakes so that they can learn
  - Timezones make it difficult to find shared learning time
    - Solve by making "focus time" on shared blocks
    - Solve by employing dynamic reteaming to not try and control when people can and cannot work - let people work and form teams when they are avalibile.
      - Term: Liquid Mobs
  - How do you get buy in from management to get learning / improvements hours?
    - Go bottom up and get short sessions going with peers - only through experiencing it do people see the value.
    - Introduce in high safty environments where they are working on non-product related stuff versus low saftey environments which is must-have product work done.
      - People started incorporating things they learned into the lower saftey environments.
  - Power structures interfere with productive / efficient ways of working
  - Prove out efficiencny of change by doing in small team specific changes - not by prophisizing
  - Book: Coaching for Learning
  - It is impossible to guague learning, attention, etc. without a camera. People must feel comfortable and safe to have their cameras on.
  - Retro frequently - such as 2 times per day during learning sessions

- Simulating Scaled Agile
  - Kanban Drivers Edition - a boardgame to simulate ways of working
