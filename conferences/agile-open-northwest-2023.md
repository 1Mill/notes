<https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMd-KINs=/>

## Key Takaways

- TODO

## Notes

### Day 1

#### LEAN Coffee

- Agile Safari: Join a company for half a day to see if prospective employee is a good fit.
  - Usually best with team programming to see how they fit and interact with the team.
  - They do this at Hunter Industries
- Being remote-first makes it easier to recruit people from across the globe.
  - Just need to figure out the timezone situtation.
- Hunter industries now only does half day team programming versus full day, perhaps because of Zoom fatigue or something else.
- How to make daily SCRUM meetings fresh
  - Stop doing the three questions: ask "How are we doing at advancing towards our sprint goal?"
  - Don't talk about each item, just talk about where we are with respect to our goal
  - Daily meetings are a good opportunity to ask for help, but not to dig into details or conversations unless it actively invovles the whole team.
  - Enforce timebox to keep the meeting going
  - ABCD Method: Announcements, Blockers, C\_, Dates
  - People are usually not actively engaged because they are thinking about that they are going to say
  - "Where did we say we wanted to be in 2 weeks and where are we at today?"
  - Focus on "we" not "I"
  - Walking through the board is time consuming
  - Queue up topics from standup and use LEAN Coffee to have meaningful and engaged conversations / breakouts.
- Using GPT
  - Success using it for writing job descriptions
  - Success for writing emails, announcements, etc. especially for editorial suggestions on a rough draft.
  - Succesds in asking it for patterns from daily announcements, etc.
  - Chat GPT and CoPilot uses private or not opened source code as a reference, so legal fears of using generated code.

#### Failure to Communicate

- Reference / Facilitator: Woody Zuill
  - How can I introduce change in a place where I am just an engineer?
  - Why do we have teams?
  - These questions lead to discovery of mob / team programming
  - Reference: [Wiio's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiio%27s_laws)
    - <https://jkorpela.fi/wiio.html>
    - Communication usually fails except by accident
    - ...
- Toast masters teach that people and hear through filters and those filters are built through their unique experiences.
  - Every reciever interprets everything differently based on their own experiences / huristics.
- People have differnt personas based on the role and psychological saftey they have with the people around them
- Compartmentalization makes solving root issues more difficult
- Reference: Dave Gray
  - My truth is not your truth
- Sometime communication is left ambigious so that people can operaete in a gray area.
- The more communication appears to suceeds the more it is failing
- People must feel safe to effectively communicate
- Reference: <https://bibliothequer.com/social/functional-stupidity-and-its-consequences-for-organizations/>
- We bring our own biases into everything we learn and hear
- Try to verify communication by asking for people clarity
- Team programming makes validating communication intent immediate
- Team programming makes communication alignment obvious
- Some people are not verbal processors so using chat to think through their response can also help include more people into the conversations
- How people are primed changes how people perceive and interpret communications

#### Product Roadmap Maturity Model

- Levels of maturity
  - Level 1: Reactive Work and One-Off Solutions
    - Work is identified based on the direct needs of your customers
    - Solutions are delivered in a non-reusable way that is customized solely for that customer/need
  - Level 2: Reactive Features and Reusable Solutions
    - Features are identified based on the direct needs of your customers
    - Solutions are built in a reusable way that allows any future customer with a similar need to be implemented without additional investment
  - Level 3: Proactive Features and Cohesive Solutions
    - Features are identified based on a desire to build a product the meets the needs of an identified target market and/or ideal customer
    - NOT based only/directly on current customers and existing needs (although these should be considered).
    - Solutions are built in a way that pulls the entire product towards the identified target market / ideal customer
  - Level 4: Market Leading
  - Level 5: Market Creation
- Technology must be an equal partner at the stakeholder level.
- Vendors lead with a lot of promises and usually have a lot of hidden costs
  - What is the usually hidden cost to manage a vendor?

#### Refreshing the Coding Dogo for Remote

- <https://ted.dev/articles/2022/01/15/remote-learning-ensembles/>
- Try and "discuss in code" versus just disussing on the abstract
- Learn non-judgemental self-observation
- Sparrow Deck to help identify code smalls, etc.
  - <https://llewellynfalco.blogspot.com/p/sparrow-decks.html>
- Find opportunities for refactoring within your own code base: not fake code.
- Work with peole on frequent small batches (e.g. 3 hours a week every Monday) versus infrequent intese session (e.g. 1 week every year)
- Start simple
- Demonstrate or ask for wrong ways to solve a problem to kick off conversations
- Think about the code critically together
- The intent is to build
  - A way to review code without being judgemental about it
  - Get on the same page about terms
- You have to let people make mistakes so that they can learn
- Timezones make it difficult to find shared learning time
  - Solve by making "focus time" on shared blocks
  - Solve by employing dynamic reteaming to not try and control when people can and cannot work - let people work and form teams when they are avalibile.
    - Term: Liquid Mobs
- How do you get buy in from management to get learning / improvements hours?
  - Go bottom up and get short sessions going with peers - only through experiencing it do people see the value.
  - Introduce in high safty environments where they are working on non-product related stuff versus low saftey environments which is must-have product work done.
    - People started incorporating things they learned into the lower saftey environments.
- Power structures interfere with productive / efficient ways of working
- Prove out efficiencny of change by doing in small team specific changes - not by prophisizing
- Book: Coaching for Learning
- It is impossible to guague learning, attention, etc. without a camera. People must feel comfortable and safe to have their cameras on.
- Retro frequently - such as 2 times per day during learning sessions

#### Simulating Scaled Agile

- Kanban Drivers Edition - a boardgame to simulate ways of working

#### Cross cultural agile

- Different cultures have different ways of working which causes miscommunication
  - Solve through ad-hoc demos frequently to verify communication was truely successful
  - Solve through 1-1 conversations
- Learn to understand and adjust ways of working to different cultures

#### Escaping the Agile Industrial Complex

- People with credentials use those credentials as an authority to do non-agie things.
- Management believes "doing agile" is at the individual contributor level, not the management level.
- Businesses care about
  - Direct Value - money
  - Learning Value - know we know
  - Option Value - we have options we didn't have before
- Companies hire people with credentials to reduce percieved risk
- Build working relationships at the team level and then work your way up the organization
- Being agile is a cultural missison which means all levels of the organization must be bought in - particularly C-Suite
- Not every part of an organization must be adaptive - but making the parts that should be adaptive be adaptive makes adapting to changes in the market much eaiser
- Right sizing of agile transformation: what level are you being brought into and what area of influence do you have?
  - Who is trying to lead the agile transformation within the company and what level of influence is being given? Sometimes, it is just making a few teams better.
- Build repor so that making change is eaiser
- Help teams realize where flow is not being achieved

#### Techincal debt

- Is it an overloaded term?
- Code quality is a snapshot in time and that definition can change over time making old previously prestine code no longer prestine code.
- Technical Dirt: teams rushing too fast without concern for quality
- Technical Debt Quadrant: <https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html>

#### Psychological Saftey Intro

- Levels
  1. Saftey to act
     - "When we feel save enough and say we have a problem here"
  2. Saftey to be
     - Do we feel safe in this environment, less about behavior
  3. Saftey is a state where we have access to our rational thinking
     - If we do not feel psychologically safe we do not have access full and total access to all our thinking power
- Two survival mechanisms
  - Freeze response is our oldest survival instinct which inhibits oxegyn to the prefrontal cortext
  - Flight or Fight is the rapid movement response which stops pushing engergy to all non-essential services - we need to react not think
- What (in theory) can we do to get higher levels of productivity? SAFTEY model
  - Security
    - Predict what is coming next in our environment - consistency, committment, certainty, no change
    - Teams have a regulare routine
  - Autonomy
    - Need to have control over our environment and have choises
    - People cannot have autonomy without security
  - Fairness
    - Our need to engage in and experience fair exchanges to us and others
  - Esteem
    - Our need to be highly regarded
    - Don't want to get kicked out
  - Trust
    - Our social need to belong and protect our group
  - You
    - Unique factors to yourself like personality, bias, etc.

#### Software Teaming

- New name for mob programming
- Mob with non-enigneers doing simple examples like FizzBuzz to help learn how the process works
- Co-locating mobbing pre COVID: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVqUcNKVbYg>
- Start learning how to mob by tackling a small function nobody likes
- Strong Style Pairing: "For an idea to go from your head into the computer it must go through someone else's hands."
- People naturally mob during high stress situations like an outage because fast and clear communication is so critical. However, why do people not fast and clear communication during less stressful situations?
- Group memory is better than individual memory which help make context switching easier and faster.
- When mobbing, the absense of one person is minimized on the work flow. With solo work, the work completely stops.
- Mobbing only works with psychological saftey.

#### Closing Circle

- Do not attribute to a person a trait that can be attributed to a company's culture.
- To support self-organization you need a container.

### Day 2

#### LEAN Coffee - day 2

- Many conferences are not interested in FAST.

#### Opening Circle

- Q1: What’s a profession or skill you’ve used before doing Agile
- Q2: Is there any way we can use that to refresh our work now?
- "We will find a way along the way" - Joel Robinson
- People that work in higher education have a collective understanding that education is extremely valuable. How can we get that same sense of mission in other environments?
- Continuous education is very valuable - particularly around making companies more efficient.
- Visualizing the work is extremely important.
- Most innovation happens when stakes are low.
- No decisions is a decision but doesn't make it a good decisions.

#### Intellectual Humility: What I don't know yet?

- During a job interview, it is okay to say "I don't know" but also dig into the problem to show how you would dig into a problem. "I don't know" is only the first step of curisoity.
  - "I don't know; lets find out!"
- People are afrid to contribute when they are uncertain if they are an authority or not on a subject
  - Try to speak to personal experiences.
  - Depends on the context of the conversation. Brainstorming is different than being a keynote speaker.
- Best practicies only work in certain contexts. Learning where the boundries of those context are is important but also only learned through trial and error.

#### Experiments and Failure: Friction in Agile Adoption

- There is so much systemic compention in the market place everything inside a company is viewed in that same way.
- Benefits of failing (and learning) are not often though of. Usually it is winning and reducing risks to minimizing losing which means doing things that are familiar.
- Failing is part of growing.
- Experimental and learning mindset are vaguely defined in most companies which means people bring in their own personal definitions / interpretations to fill any voids.
- Learning must be intentional and explicit within an organization.
- "A bug is a difference between what you expect and what you got" - Matt Plavcan.
- Having a hypothesis sets boundaries and helps communicate / frame expectations and what is hoped to be learned.
- Reference: Celebration Grid
  - Active learning happens through intentional expermentation
- Without failure there is no learning and is not a bad thing
- Celebrate failures that drive learning so that failing to learn becomes a cultural norm
- How do we get to this culture of learning through failure?
  - Lead by example at an individual level.
  - Experiment using time boxes to help cut scope which in term gets to the essense of a theme of work
  - You need to measure something to know if the experiment worked or not
  - Must have a way to verify the hypothesis
- Some companies think of experiments as deliberatly trying to make mistakes to stress tests systems rather than learning how to build better in the long term

#### Software Teaming Question and Answer

- How do you present mob programming to other teams?
  - Just share things to make things fun and get people intersted
  - People have to come to it at their own free will
- Paired programming, let alone mob programming, is not widely adopted - Woody Zuill
- Software engineers typically think of themselves as solo artists not band mates
- Do mob programming in a new environment like a private room to get people out of their normal day to day contexts

#### Software Teaming, [Mob Programming, Ensemble] And Flow

- Changes the focus from the individual (low bus factor) to the team (high bus factor) - resiliance
- Change the focus from an individual's flow to a team's flow
- Book: Flow
  - Invisible queues are the most expensive problem in product development
  - Backlogs are queues and inventory - waste upon waste
  - Waiting for another team to finish task A so you can work on task B is another queue
- Software Teaming is always moving the work forward towards the customer
- If a team is at max utilization then any teams dependent on that team must wait until their work is plucked from the queue and means they are not making progress on that work at all.
- Most companies try to maximize utilization which increases queues which manifest themselves in the form of waiting
- Obsticals to getting management to buy-in
  - Most managers use resource accounting derived from the factory mindset.
  - Historically resources meant machines which now translates into programmers
  - If a programmer is not 100% utlizies like a machine then money is being wasted, but does not account for the invisible queues that significantly increase time to deliver.
- Mob programming only persists if it is bought in by management because management feel it is wasteful.
  - Get data to support change.
- Introduce mob programming inadventeraly through asking for help to look into some bug, some function, etc. to introduce the ideas.
- Traditionally companies believe people working seperately get more stuff done.
  - "I don't want to get 1 thing done I want to get 5 things done" - is there research to support this claim?
- A mob can be of any size.
- Diffussion is innovation - mobbing needs early adopters to provide more successful examples for early majority.
- "Science advances one dead scientists at a time" as new ideas are embraced by new generations.
- Mobbing makes work more fun and social
- If a market competitor adopts mob programming, who is that benefiting? The competitor or the companies they are competing against?
- "Does mobbing not work in general or not here? Because mobbing works in other places"
- Examples of mobs where each members contributes in their own ways:
  - Bands
  - Surgery - a nurse has slack (i.e. idle time) so they can react to whatever the team needs instantly
  - Pilots
- Managers try to make things easier to manage - Woody Zuill

#### Measurement - What is wrong with this? Change Yourself

- Ourselves are the easiest person for ourselves to fool
- Planned versus completed is sometimes the only metric some companies look at. Does not answer if the team is working on the right things / is customer value being delivered?
  - Very output driven versus outcome driven
- On time and on budget is not a good meausre of customer value
- Reference: Chaos Report
- Metrics give teams focus, however, is that the right focus?
  - If a goal is to fix bugs but there are 0 bugs how can you fix what doesn't exist?
- A single metric to determin the impact of multiple activies seems dubious.

#### Speaking/Presenting at Conferences

- Sometimes people need to hear information from multiple different people about the same topic before it clicks. So never be afraid to share on a topic that somebody else or you have already presented on before.
  - Reference: [Lucky 10,000](https://xkcd.com/1053/)
- Reference: <https://pnsqc.org/blog/blog/2023-03-22-how-to-write-an-abstract-for-pnsqc>
  - Write a good elevator pitch otherwise they won't read the rest
  - Write a peer reviewed paper that ensures your presentation is well rounded and/or focused instead of meandering.
  - A paper lets you structure and translate your paper into a presentation without a fear of it not being relevant.
- Get feedback early on presentations
- Spin common activites with your unique perspective. Breaking down user stories may be familiar to everybody but perhaps you do something different others hadn't considered before.
- You don't have to be the expert when you present. Just speak to personal experience.
- Use social media like YouTube to make presentations without having to do it at a conference to practice and discover what your process is.
  - Maximize feedback by sharing
  - Build portfolio
- Michael Larson does something called "live blogging" - seems similar to what this document is...

#### Coaching UP - what we've learned and can share to improve our approaches in our leadership engagement

- Ask to try something out just to see if this thing turns out to be super awesome
- "I am trying to help you solve your problem, will you let me help by trying X?"
- Get buy-in by being aligned about the problems trying to be solved.
- Ensure that problems trying to be solved are problems higher ups want to be solved - part of their job responsibilities / something in their domain.
- Build trust with leader
  - Have shared experiences (i.e. you have worked in their role before)
  - Frame ideas / experiments in ways that make sense to the person being worked with
- "Agile is for them not for me" in agile transformations
  - Successful transformations require top-to-bottom shifts in cutlure
  - Changing behaviors (i.e. performings standups) is not a mindshift change.
- Build relationships to be invited to the table with higher ups
  - Actively listen to the problems they are trying to solve
  - Give higher ups options so they can pick their own adventure, even if it perhaps the long road
  - You must be trying to solve their problems, not your problems.
- Book: Inspired
- Leadership loves metrics
  - Use metrics to help higher ups understand how they are serving their employees
- You can only coach a team if you are also coaching their manager at the same time because the working agreements need to change.
- You can only coach if you have a coachable team. If people are not interested then it doesn't matter how much you try.

#### Time Shred and the Flow of work

- Being interupted virtually is more socially acceptable then in person.
- Shift cultural expecations that people will respond when the time is right: not immediately.
- Use malicous compliance to highlight where issues are in the system
  - Give yourself a 1 WIP limit. If a PR takes 3 days it is what it is - eventually somebody will notice wait.
- Call everything an "experiment" to get people to participate. Also timebox so that it is only a 30 minute committment like "live PR review"
  - Easier to ask for an hour than a day
- You need social capital
- The work is blocked - not a person.
- Multitasking is 1 thing being worked on and all other work being blocked.
- An ideal person is never blocking work
- Do not keep people busy (max resource utilization) and instead focus on delivering work faster (max flow utilizaion).
  - Flow requires slack / ideal time.
  - A freeway at 100% utilization is gridlock - people and teams are the same way.
- Book: The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement
- Reference: Litte's Law
  - Working on one thing each items arrives at the absolutely fastest time
  - Working on everything delivers everything at exactly the same time
  - A team has to find that balance fastest and quantity.
- Big chunks do not flow well. Break chunks into smaller chunks.
- Book: [Slack](https://www.amazon.com/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficiency/dp/0767907698)

#### Closing Circle - day 2

- Referenc: Gemini Agile
- Zero silos
- Software should help people. Is this software making humanity better?
- "It's a reminder of how often I've worked in environments which neglect team effectiveness and knowledge transfer, which interpret 'embrace change' as 'jump into the whirlpool" - Jeff Miller

### Day 3

#### LEAN Coffee - day 3

- Sometimes people have perceptions that no conflict is the best conflict.
- Healthy confict sharpens ideas.
- Humans can hold dialog in their head for a very long time.
- Sitting side by side versus face to face creates different types of conversations - "are we walking together or into each other"
- "If somebody expresses intent, unless you have a reason to deny it, run with it!" - Woody Zuill
- Argue pros and cons from the other perspective
- Make conversations about the idea, not the person
- Reference: <https://mathlair.allfunandgames.ca/fourcard.php>
- Reference: Asset Based Community Management
  - <https://johnmcknight.org/>
- DevOps is a post-XP framework just like Fast or
- References: Promiscuous Pairing
  - Rotate pairing with all members of the team frequently: not just a single person.
  - This ensures that knowledge is distributed across the team and not concentrated in a small group

#### Opening Circle - day 3

- Create an affinity board about "What are you passionate about?" to find topics to talk about in an open space.
- Three types of open space sessions
  - I would like to share ...
  - I want to learn about ...
  - I want to work on this ...
- Reference: James Shore Nullables
- What is sustainability erosution as delivering customer values becomes more and more complex within a company over time and how can we address it (Kevin & Woody Z.)?
- Book: <https://www.amazon.ca/Gender-Knot-Unraveling-Patriarchal-Legacy/dp/1439911843>
- Tool: <https://logseq.com/>

#### The theory underlying Agile, or the 5-whys of Agile

- Every engineering practice is only good until the world changes.
- A solid theory enables practicies to adapt
- Agile for teams works pretty well but agile at scale runs into friction
  - Mostly for social reasons
- Large companies don't really care much about culture they care more about continuing to be large companies
- Agile is more of a mindset, not a process, that tries to maximize social interactions to encourage good processes
- Healthy practicies increase the health of the system.
- Most business systems are complex so agents (i.e. people) change the system through their actions which impacts the health of the system.
- Minimizing waste is a health habit.
- Reference: Queueing theory - why works waits / gets blocked
- Frame ideas / new processes to try as short timeboxed experiments
- Agile and growth mindset are usually equated - Aki Namioka
  - Usually related in a lot of ways like respondig to change
- Agile / Growth mindset fail when it meets command and controll - Aki N.
  - Results in doing agile (in practice) versus being agile (in theory)
- "Everybody wants to drive the bus - but not everyone can. Agile can help who drives the bus, along with when and why that happen" - John
- Self organization does not mean somebody isn't in control, it just lets control flow more elegency throughout a team: it doesn't have to be the same person in controll 100% of the time.
- Sprints are just a container to build a common understanding about what is being worked on.
- It is easier to maintain quality in smaller iterations over large iterations
- Small iterations let teams get feedback more frequently from customers
  - Creates opportunities to pivot if needed
- Reference: Beyond Budgeting
  - The annual budgeting process is the bane of American Corporations - Aki N
  - Use rolling forecasts
  - The leadtime between discovery to delivery can be 14+ months because of fixed budgets and out dated plans.
- Agile is a mindset, and really the desire to learn from through failed experiments, must be embraced through the entire organization to succeed.
- How do we bridge agile into the future?
  - Intorduce these ideas to new generations

#### Six lenses for seeing team/system

1. As parts only - We only see the parts of the syste, not the whole
   - What I experience
   - No boundaries, just parts
   - Organized by what is there today
2. As machines - We break everything down into small parts and define the function they play to make the systme work
   - Objective
   - Closed systems
   - Organized by a rational controller / CEO
3. As living creatures - We see systems tak on charactieric os living organizisms that are learning, growing, and changing
   - Subjective
   - Open systems
   - Organized by a rational controller / CEO
4. As connections - We see the system as creations of the connections between different parts
   - Normative
   - Boundaries are soft
   - Organized by rational participants and cultural norms
5. As complex and adaptive - We see as a collective of semiautonomus agents interacting and adapting to each other
   - Complex
   - Boundaries are based on interactions and their interdependencies
   - Organized by attrators on agents (i.e. how people want to contribute)
6. There are no systems - we see the autonomy and interdependencies without the self-organizing container

#### A Fresh Look at Agile Scaling

- Purpose of scaling - Halim Dunsky
  - Spread the goodness of agility done well
  - Balance alignment, coordination, and autonomy across the enterprise
  - Customer value and orgnaizational (i.e. employee) quality of life
- Domains of scaling - Halim
  - Team ability - everything about engineering practicies and performance
  - Technical coordination - everything about architecture, interfaces; building and operating the thing in the right way
  - Goal coordiation - building the right thing from market place feedback
  - Process coordiination - dependency management; planning, architecture, shared processes, etc.
  - Vision coordination - portofilo / funding management; balancing responsibility with responsivness
  - Visibility - how information flows through an organization; can people see the things they need to see?
  - Top down and bottom up - There is huge value in both the sattalite and frontlines views, learn to combine these
  - Organizational change approach - What does change look like and how does it go from started to finished?
  - Engagement with culture challanges - collaborative, command and controll, diversity, etc.; how does a company engage with the real needs of organizational culture.
- Use a subjective scale to measure how each employee feels the company is doing in each of these categories to inform wher the company can start improving.
- Standardization is tricky because of it's balance between control (i.e. diminished autonomy) and value to the business.

#### Turn up the Good

- Just in time retospectives
- Try and amplify what is working well but do not ignore the bad because it can fester
- Having slack in the system makes people feel less stressed
- A lot of little things created a better working environment
- Most of what we consider management just makes it hard to do the work - Woody Z. paraphrasing somebody else
  - More management is rarely the answer to solving business problems.
- People self-organize their day
- Try and create larger and larger cultural bubbles
- It is easy to not awknowledge wins

#### What is Sustainability Erosion?

- Overtime code becomes steadly more maintain, steadly more complex, steadly more problems... that the organization starts adding barriers to deploying code. This code used to be making progress but now it is unsustainable. - Kevin Meadows
  - "Accrued more \_ than we can master" - Kevin M.
- Common Outcomes
  - Engineer ask for time to reachitecture and the process starts over again
  - Capability Trap: teams fight so many fires progress can never be made.
    - Working overtime to keep the system alive, never a feeling of enough time to actually fix the problem.
    - Work harder, harder, and harder and getting less and less value.
- This is made worse when we seperate workers that should be working together.
  - People working idependently create hidden abstractions, duplicate, code, same problem different solution
  - Deadline problems make problem worse - put TODO in code because people know it isn't quite right.
- When people collaborate more through Software Teaming / mob programming many of these problems fade away because of real-time code review, quality checks, etc.
- Sustainable Erosion: thing start out good but erode over time.
- Greenfield always start out fast.

#### Refresh: Agile Principles

- Change the word "working software" to the "working product"
  - People disengaged from "working sofware" because they were not software engineers.
  - Encouraged a shift in perspective to feature slice from an end-to-end perspective not just a code perspective.
- A product manager must be part of the team, sitting with the mob writing the code to quickly answer "Is this what you meant?" without having to play telephone.
  - Truely embeded, not just there for the morning meeting.
- Teams have to be intentional about bulding social relationships. In remote first environments the water cooler disappeared.
  - Create a Zoom that is always open - this is the team's space to collaborate, work, invite others to have conversations, etc.
- Have clear and explicit working agreements when it comes to Slack in remote first environments.
- Get to know people as people: talk about things that aren't work related.
- For many tech people the nice paycheck and quality of life are equal across many companies so they are seeking more mission driven organizations as the diffierientating factor.
- A lot of principles derived from self-organization around meaningful contributions, autonomoy, connecting with others, etc. are all focused on building motivated individuals.
- Reference: Motivation 3.0
  - Must have purpose
  - Must have autonomy
  - Must have mastery / continue to grow / continue to get better - which is often lost at many companies because people are boxed into one role.
- Reference: Personal User Guides
  - Inform others how to best utilize you
- Continous development is about building not pivoting / context switching between goals

#### The Elephants

- "Organizations have elephants which are blairing but unsaid" - April Jefferson
- When an economy goes bad or a budget becomes tighter a company goes the opposite way of agile and go back to more command and controller
  - During a crisis people revert to the most efficient strategy which is usually activities they are most familiar with which by chance is command and control.
- Companies want to try and add guardrailes to grassroots because it is percieved to be so uncertain versus embrasing innovation.
- Insurence companies want to grow, get market share, etc. but insurence companies are actively trying not to take on new business because they are struggling to produce business value. - John
- Product managers responsibile for customer value and Scrum masters responsible for productivity? - John.
- Slighting management for not being agile. How can we get them onboard or bought in? - Thomas O'Connor.
  - Difference in power so either side is not listening to each others challanges and solutions. Need to bridge that gap.
- Percieved job security working for a larger company versus a 5 person start up.
  - Lots of uncertainty, risk, etc. that it would all fail.
- The business is usually proxied by a group that takes the responsibility without the accountability - John
  - Many tech folks see "the business" (i.e. management) as the problem and waste - John
  - Ask managers to screen share to facilitate shared working contexts.
- "Are the people making big decisions making good decisison?" - Jeff Miller
- Jounrey through emotions to come to solutions rather than ignore them. - Marielle Mooijekind
- Replicating a customer problem is sometimes impossible until you see the customer doing it.
- Psychological saftey is need to talk about elephants.
- Lots of people with their camera off
  - Feeling of lack of contribution or purpose
  - Passive versus active speaking roles
