## Notes

* Systems are easier to undersatnd through pictures than words. Feedback loops are complex and chaining. So pictures communicate that non-linear complexity easier than linear language.
* The behavior of a system cannot be known only by the elements in which the system is made. A system is more than the sum of its individual parts.
* Systems are composed of elements, connections, and a function or purpose.
  * What would a system look like without one of these things?
* `1 + 2 = 3` only because you understand the concepts of `1`, `2`, and `+` (addition) in math. So, the elements by themselves mean very little without the mathmatical framework itself.
* System goals can be observed through behavior, not claimed or aspirational goals perhaps stated by the elements / people in the system itself. Systems optimize themselves around their real goals - not their believed goals.
* Systems react to signals. These signals may be tangible like cars in a parking lot or intangible like good will for a friend.
* A true change in purpose should profoundly change the system even if all the elements and interconnections stay the same, they should all be doing something differently.

* Systems contain inflows and outflows. To fill up bathtub you can either reduce outflow or increase inflow. Doing neither will maintain the status quo: equilibrium.
* Stocks / inventory are buffers. They take time to fill and diminish. So, use changes in stock to observe how changes to inflow and outflow are impacting the stock.If it is good, cool. If it is bad, adjust. Eitehr eways, ssytems are slow to change because of their inertia so use that buffer to make sure you are heading in the right direction.
* Stocks allo inflows and outflows to be decoiupled from one another, providing flexbility.
* Feedback loops are rules, policies, reactions, etc. based on that current level of the stock in order to change the inflows or outflows of that stock.
* Balacning feedback loops seek to maintain stability around some ideal range. For example, a head pump keeps a house around a desired tempature by cycling between both hot and cold air. This behavior is called its homing behavior.
* Reinforcing feedback loops can be positive or negative. Effectively, the more stock the more flow the more stock or less stock less flow less stock. 100$ in the bak gains interest which then compounds with time. On the other hand, 100$ in the bank with negative interest goes to 0$ with time.
* When you think A causes B, challenge yourself to also think how B may cause A to change in a reinforcing feedback loop.
* Information from feedback can only influence behavior going forward: not in retrospect so there will always be a delay in responding / reacting to any sort of feedback.
* Reinforcing and balancing feedback loops pulling a the same stock is common in almost all systems. Populations grow through birth rates (reinforcing, the more people the more chance for more births in the next generation) and balancing through death rates (e.g. competition for food)

* A delay in a balancing feedback loop results in oscillation as the system goes above and below trying to maintain the desired state via its homing behavior (e.g. heat pump cycling hot and cold to keep a room at a consistent tempature)
* Delays are a big lever in changing the behavior of a system. Being too reactive may cause thrashing (e.g. thermostate cycling hot, cold, hot, cold, hot, very rapidly) but being too long makes you slow to respond in a meaningful way (e.g. analysis paralysis). Hunt for delays, their root causes (e.g. physical, informational) and then experiment with them to get the system to maintain a desired state with minimal thrashing.
* Systems are often contrained by real world things (e.g. food, energy, labor) which they themselves have their own feedback loops. So loops all the way down.
Renewable resources are flow limited, they can sustain growth and harvesting indefinitely if managed appropriately. Over harvesting leads to destructive outcomes which eliminates the resources (e.g. over cutting trees, burning out employees).
* Resilience is an outcome of multiple feedback loops working on different mechanisms to keep the system in the desired state.
* Information being delayed too long or distorted through multiple layers is why organizations become disfunctional and loose their resiliency.
* Self-orgnaization is the default state of collaboration observed in nature. Self-organization is often sacrificed for short term stability which inhibits resiliency.
* Fractals in math follow simple rule sets. Self-organizing is the same way: simple rules build a container for folks to freely explore, experiment, and discover better ways of doing the work.

* Stable systems enable higher order systems to build on top of them. For example, a reliable and stable mailing system enables small business to grow around and on top of that system to reliably deliver their goods to customers. But, that does not mean the internals are not complex. Just, the interface and outputs are stable and reliable enough to build on top of. We see the same thing in quantum mechanics (e.g. quark soup). This is where hierarchies originate from and enable more and more complexity to be hidden.
* Hierarchies often emerge natrually from self-orgnaizing systems in order to help the parts all do better. This comes from a place to do better together rather than a need or a mandate.
* Must balance the needs of systems in a hierarchy. A rouge cell in the body is called cancer. A strongly centralized decision maker inhibits productivity.
* Heirarchtical systems evolve from the bottom up to serve the needed purpose of the lower layers (e.g. coordination) without compromising the self-organizing structure within the lower layers themselves.
* Resilience, self-organization, and herarchy are 3 of the reasons dyanmic ssytems work so well and are some of the levers which can be pulled to change system behavior.

* Events are easy to see and a symptom of some system. If you map events in historical context they give more insight into the system than just the isolated event itself. Context which helps you understand the system versus just the outputs. This helps understand the how and why and ultimiately what bhavior does this sytem encourage?
* Event, behavior, structure.
* Focus on events or flow helps in the short term, but does not make changes to the underlying system which made those events or changes in flow happen. FOr example, short term sprinting versus long term marathoning.
* Most system relationships are non-lineaeer. A population can have exponential growth until starvation has exponential decay.
