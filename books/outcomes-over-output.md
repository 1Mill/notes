## Key Takeaways

* An outcome is a measurable change in human behavior which drives business results. This change is often targeted towards customers to drive key behaviors which effect profits (e.g. more clicks, more subscriptions). But this can also target employees. Changes in human behavior which drive down costs are easy examples, like removing inefficient practicies or policies which increase operating costs. Ultimiately though, outcomes are levers to business results (i.e. impacts) which challange the status quo.

* Practicies do not make you agile. Being agile is about learning and adapting to what you just learned. If you fail to learn or fail to adapt to what you just learned then you are not agile. Often time this means working in "unconventional" ways because learning and responding to change are more valuable outcomes then following a prescribed plan.

* Program Logic Model
  * Resources: People, infastructure, trees (things we have)
  * Activity: Discovery, delivery (things we can do)
  * Output: Features we delivered (things we did because of our doing / activity)
  * Outcome: Change in behavior (behavior we changed because of our outputs)
  * Impact: Goal, mission (e.g. good customer service)

* Probe, sense, respond is the most efficient way to build non-commodity software (i.e. Complex Cynefin domain). In practice, this means (1) identifying a high-priority and ideal change in customer behavior (i.e. outcome), (2) identifying lagging and leading indicators which demonstrate this change in behavior (i.e. metrics), and (3) experimenting with multiple solutions to improve identified metrics and most critically to learn. To stay adaptable, make experiments small and safe to cancel or fail, challange assumptions, and hunt for causations. The great thing is, if this is a truely high-pririty outcome teams can work on improving this outcome indefinitely until priorities change or they have achieved their goal because software is a living product and so it is never truely "done" in any final sense of the word.

* Lagging indicators measure past behavior whereas leading indicators predict future behavior. Use lagging indicators to confirm hypothesis for experiments but use leading indicators to (1) verify their predictive behavior and (2) check if you are heading in the right direction. A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is "the smallest thing we can do or make to see if our hypothesis is true". Take incremental steps; probe-sense-respond. Don't swing for the stars and expect to get it right the first time.

* Magic questions (p. 27):
  1. What are the customer behaviors that drive business results? (outcomes)
  2. How can we get people to do more of those behaviors (experiments, outputs)
  3. How do we know that we're right? (metrics)

* Framing conversations or work in terms of outcomes and impacts helps everybody in the organization understand and align around the strategy. Sometimes it can be difficult to articlate outcomes though. So a good stepping stone is asking "What are you worried about and why?" These worries are often outcomes and the "why" often links them to impacts.

* A team working towards outcomes should not be working from backlogs, instead they should be working from a customer journey. Customer journies visualize how customers interact with your product. It is these touch points with the product where customer behavior can be changed because of your product (i.e. outcomes). Learning, experimenting, and optimizing these customers navigate these journies are where customer outcomes are improved. In a similar vein, employees are customers of process. To improve employee outcomes see how employees interact and navigate through your buisness to realize a different set of outcomes (e.g. cost reduction, increased productivity).

* Teams often adopt a fire-and-forget mindsets with outputs so they never learn. This is often from preasure to deliver faster and faster (e.g. increase velocity). Many organizations reward outputting more and more. But, agility is all about learning and using those learnings to improve customer outcomes which drive profitability. This requires doing some output, but too often the learning is neglegted or outsourced from the team doing the work. So, teams become mercenary teams who are rewarded for this fire-and-forget mindset instead of creating profitible customer outcomes because that is somebody else job (i.e. no ownership). Instead, executives define outcomes and teams should work to improve those outcomes through metrics improved through outputs. But the outputs should not be defined by the executives, instead by the team.

* Executives and employees should all have the same response when asked to describe the current strategy of the company. If they give different responses, it means the organization is not aligned and results in fighting over resources because people are trying to go different directions. Break the strategy down into 3 easy to remember bullet points. This won't be easy and there will be much fighting over what those 3 bullet points are, so run experiments and create a working group to get it right. But in the end the focus and alignment will seep their way into the company zeitgeist to enable autonomous and more effective decision making.

## Notes

### Chapter 1: What are outcomes?

* Designs and prototypes might test well, so it might encourage build builds / releases, but the goal is to build profitable working software.
* *An outcome is a change in human behavior that drives business results.*
* Practicies do not make you agile. Doing standups does not mean you are listening to the voice of the customer to build profitable working software.
  * Agility is a balance between adapting through learning while doing.
* Products are never done: we just decide when to start working on a different part of it versus another.
  * This mindset conflicts with the assembly mindset in that when a car is off the line it is "done".
* "... features don't automatically create value ..." - p 12

* Outcomes are changes in human behavior which drive positive results.
* Outcomes makes it easier to assess if the output had the desired effect.
* Opportunity Solution Trees may be a way to break down large mission statements like "be profitable" with more targeted and narrows outcomes that smaller teams can meaningfully achieve.

* Managing outputs: telling the team what to make.
* Managing outcomes: ask a team to improve a specific customer behavior when is hypothesized to drive business results.
  * Let the team come up and deliver solutions / value.

* Program Logic Model: Resources -> Activities -> Outputs -> Outcomes -> Impact
  * Impact: Drive profitability
  * Outcome: Change customer behavior in some way (did it have the desired impact?)
  * Output: Deliverying a feature (what did we do?)
  * Activity: Discovery, Delivery (what do we think we can do?)
  * Resources: People, infastructure (what do we have today?)

* Extension of the agile manifesto for modern product development: "Our highest priority is to satisfy the custoemr through early and continous deliver of value." - p. 15
* "What is the csutomer behavior change that we are looking for?" - p 15
* Sometimes starting with a solution helps identify the outcome being work towards, but once an outcome is identified always consider alternative solutions.
* Being agile is all about running short safe-to-fail experiments: generate a hypothesis, build, learn.

* As a manager, manage outcomes. Managing output just means the team works from a backlog. Managing impact means the team is too directionless. Managing outcomes gives the team a clear direction but the freedom to learn and deliver value which should trickle up to have a larger impact on the buisness.

### Chapter 2: Using outcomes

* Reference: Jared Spool
  * Execuitive care only about increasing revenues, decreasing costs, increasing new business, and market share. - p. 21
* Unlike factories, software executives cannnot simply "produce more" - so they need to leverage the whole organization / department through outcomes in order to drive impact in one (or more) of the areas they care about.

* Customer loyality is an "impact" driven by "outcomes" like good customer service, exellent product experience, etc. (which are themselves not "outputs" but rather the result of various "outputs")

* "What are the customer behaviors that drive business results?" - p. 23
* "What are things customers do that predict X"? - p. 23
* *Outcomes are things people / customers do so they are observable and measurable.*

* Lagging indicators: past measured behavior which reflects something has already happened (e.g. customer logged in)
* Leading indicators: behavior which predicts other behaviors (e.g. populare affiliate product link -> more likely to purchase)
* Use leading indocators to form hypothesis and lagging indicators to confirm those hypothesis to understand how to leverage customer behavior.
* Minimum Viable Product (MVP): "the smallest thing we can do or make to see if our hypothesis is true." - p. 26

* Magic questions (p. 27):
  1. What are the customer behaviors that drive business results? (outcomes)
  2. How can we get people to do more of those behaviors? (outputs)
  3. How do we know that we're right? (metrics / measurements)

* When communicating within the organization, use outcomes to frame the conversation to link the work the team is outputting on the impact executives are looking for teams to have.
  * E.g. Executive wants to reduce costs. The support team knows support costs are high because of bad product UX. The outcome is to improve the product UX to reduce support costs. Measured by hypothozed reduction in support calls for those features.
* Visualizing this impact -> outcome -> output chain coupled with data / metrics to support the effect the output work is having on the outcome + impact is extremely valuable versus just going off gut feeling.

* When stuck working from a prescribed backlog of work, ask the question "What human (e.g. employee, customer) behaviors has this inititive created that are driving business results?" - p. 30
* Ask repeadedly: "What new behaviors did your work create that are creating value for the business?" - p. 32

### Chapter 3: Outcomes-based planning

* Leader / executives working across multiple teams need to focus on systems-of-outcomes instead of outcomes themselves.

* Use customer journies to understand opportunities to improve certain outcomes. Then, build your opportunity-roadmap around the touch points in this customery journey to improve customer outcomes.
* Customer journies visualize customer behavior.
* Annotate your customer journey with things you know about customers and/or their interactions with the product.
  * Where are the frustrating parts?
  * Whare are the things the team noticies (e.g. meeting in-person increases conversions in a 2-sided marketplace)
  * Where are customers getting stuck?

* To improve customer outcome `[outcome]` to impact `[business result]`, we think we can do `a`, `b`, and/or `c`.
* When presented with a mandate to increase an impact, always start with "What behaviors in the system that predict higher `X` exist today and how can we go about encouraging those behaviors more?"

* Planning with outputs limits teams agility because they cannot adjust to new learnings: their course if already fixed.

### Chapter 4: Specifying value

* Validating or discussing ROI is difficult, so people often just assume the idea they have is going to work and then go straight into planning, estimates, etc., but the thing is ROI is not customer value.
* Technology is the business, and visa versa - you cannot have a successful product without both mindsets.
* Focus conversations on creating behavior (outcomes), not delivering features (outputs).

* "Value is realized not when a feature is delivered, but only when people use it." - p. 53
  * So often teams fire-and-forget features / outputs, not spending the time learning or adapting the feature to meet customer needs. This is often because outputs serve a short-term personal outcome versus a long-term business impact.

* Frameworks like OKRs are ment to re-structure the organization, but too often they are just used to rename the existing process, soution -> outcomes -> impact can be used the same way.
* Outcomes are customer focused, which require deep understanding and discussion about customer behavior and intention. This is different from how most organizations work: from backlogs.
* It is critical to link possible solutions to outcomes to impacts soundly - otherwise it is just wild speculation which defauls to normal power dynamics (e.g. HIPPO).

### Chapter 5: Organizing for outcomes

* Organizations are almost always structured around making stuff (inputs to outputs), not customer outcomes.
* Teams at 100% utilization cannot think critically about customer outcomes / value - they are stuck in the utilization trap.
* Most of the time "Build feature X" is really an ask to "Improve outcome Y" - framing it this one gives teams a lot more flexibility in how to solve the business problem.
* Working on important outcomes gives teams the time, space, and confidence to do meaningful discovery to collect raw ideas to then experiment with solutions instead of just working from a backlog.
* The only profibable customer outcomes are the ones which also move a business outcome at the exact same time.

* Design -> Engineering is a common waterfall pattern to fall into - see feedback from everybody, especially customers, early and often.
* A fixed date and a fixed requirements list is an anti-pattern in the agile space - if you keep one you must ditch the other.

* When a org restructures, it should also throw out the backlog because it is only throwing out the false hope it was going to get done in the first place.

* A quick way to get at what outcomes are important in the near term is to know what leaders are worried about. These worries are often more outcome focused than output focused.

* "it's a big fundamental shift, and it's giving up control. The challenge is that the people who are figuring out what to do are no longer the people who own the results. We're separating the responsibility. That's fine, but it's a shift in the way we think." - p. 68
  * Leaders define outcomes, teams work to improve those metrics.
* Make it safe to fail psychologically and monetarily, otherwise teams will never learn how to improve.
* Agility is all about learning and adapting to new market conditions.

### Chapter 6: Outcomes for transformation

* 3 rules for outcome based transformations in organizations:
  1. Your colleagues are your customers.
  2. Everything is an outcome.
  3. Everything is an experiment.

* Reference: Good Strategy / Bad Strategy
  * "A good strategy is a coherent mix of policy and action designed to surmount a high-stakes challenge." - p. 73
* "What happens if we think of X as our customers? What mix of policy and action could we put in place to improve outcome Y? What change in behavior on the part of X could we observe to see if we've succeeded?" - p. 73

* Executives, employees, etc. should all have the same response when asked to describe the current strategy of the company. If you get different, then it means the org is not aligned. Figure out policy, process, etc. changes to change this observable behavior.
* Break strategies down into 3 easy to remember bullet points. Making these easier to recall will make it easy to remember and thus easier to influence decision making.

* Start with an outcome and work backwards to find the next most reasonable opportunity to explore - start small and let things evolve to realize big outcomes.
