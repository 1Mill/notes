## Key Takways

* Key metrics for measuring performance of software teams:
  1. Delivery lead time to seek feedback often
  2. Deployment frequencey to avoid human made bottlenecks
  3. Time to restore service so people can sleep easy at night
  4. Change fail rate so people can deploy without debilitating fear

* In learning cultures metrics are helped to drive improvement and innovation whereas in non-learning cultures they are used to command and control.

* How a team works together is more important than who the individuals on the team are. ["When a flower doesnâ€™t bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower."](https://julieparkerpracticesuccess.com/when-a-flower-doesnt-bloom-you-fix-the-environment-in-which-it-grows-not-the-flower/)

* Automate all repretative work and relentlessly pursue continous self and team improvement. Building products is an inherently creative art so get people to a point where they can focus on solving creative only-humans-can-do business challanges instead of manually testing code, manually inspecting others code, constantly rewriting code, constantly fighting fires, or constantly fighting tools.

* Visualize business outcomes, team goals, the status of work, and how everything links together.

* Processes must be light and flexible: not imposing. If something grows to be imposing maybe the wrong people are working together. Or, maybe somebody is missing important context. Either way, it is likely an environment issue: something is too constraining or communication is lacking.

* LEAN Product Development Practicies
  1. Slice work into tiny batches which can be released within a week: including MVPs, spikes, etc.
  2. Teams understand and have visibility into how work flows from the business to customers
  3. Teams actively seek and act on customer feedback to improve products
  4. Teams have authority to change product requirements without external approval based on customer feedback.

* People are the heart of any transformation or culture shift: seek promotors. Nurture promotors through real working examples (not just theory).

* Characteristics of a transformational leader:
  1. Clear vision on where the company is going today and where it should be in 5 years
  2. Inspirational communication which motivates or guides during uncertainty or in changing environments.
  3. Intellectual stimulation to challenge others to think of problems in new ways
  4. Supportive leadership who demonstrates care and consideration of others through language and action.
  5. Personally recognizes and praises others achievements and masterworks.

* Good company cultures have:
  1. High trust
  2. Fosters transparent information flow
  3. Builds working relationships between people
  4. Encourages novelty
  5. Shares risks

* Good team cultures have:
  1. Information is actively sought
  2. Messengers are not punished when they deliver bad news
  3. Responsibilities are collectively shared
  4. Cross functional collaboration is encouraged and rewarded
  5. Failure caues inquery: not blame
  6. New ideas are actively sought
  7. Failure are viewed as opportunities to improve

* Metrics are created by people for people. People are prone to error and people are prone to change. Metrics should help a person tell a story but should not be the story itself. Always tell the human narrative behind the metric.

* Invest in people today to get the most out of people tomorrow.

* Changing the way you work changes routines which changes culture. To change how you work you must be able to learn in a safe environment. If the culture is "you failed, you fired" people will play it safe stunting innovation.

* To change culture, answer these questions:
  * How do we learn how to learn?
  * How do I learn?
  * How can I make it safe for others to learn?
  * How can I learn from and with them?
  * How do we, together, establish new behaviors and new ways of thinking that build new habits and cultivate our new culture?
  * Where do we start?

* Culture is unique to each company - experiment with other company's processes / habits to learn but find what works uniquely for you: make it your own.

* To guide change:
  * Develop and maintain a mindset for learning
  * Discover your own better practicies unique to your team, company, etc.
  * Invest in others
  * Lead by example
  * Practice discipline, courage, patience, and practice (learn, succeed, fail, adjust, repeat)

* High performing teams and product market fit are market differentiators are an output of company culture.

## Notes

* Work is work: don't have have a backlog for technical debt versus features versus ...
* People are an organizations #1 asset.
* You need leadership support in action, not only words.
* Teams must be able to fail to learn
* Use external examples to influence change (i.e. working examples versus theory)

* Authors studied many organizations across different industries
* Improvement is possible as long as leadership commits the resources and members commit to improve
* Used snowball sampling
  * "...existing study subjects recruit future subjects from among their acquaintances."
* Key research questions:
  * What does it mean to deliver software and can it be measured?
  * Does software delivery impact organizations?
  * Does culture matter and how do you measure it?
  * What technical practicies appear to be important?

* Technology is the tool used by companies to serve people more effectively: making their business more competitive in the market.

* Focus on capabilities, not maturity.
* Maturity models helps organizations get to a mature state and then are considered "done" whereas capability models help companies to consciously focus on improving.
* Capability models are dynamic and customizable which let teams, departments, etc. adjust them to their needs.
* Capabilities set a big picture from leadership for teams to work towards
* Focusing on capability teams can continously focus on improvement and focusing on the right capabilities companies drive improvements in their outcomes

### Chapter 2: Measuring Performance

* Most measures focus on outputs rather than outcomes (e.g. lines of code vs improved customer experience)
* Velocity is often misused for capacity planning or compairing how must "faster" one team is versus another
* Velocity is often misused to maximize utilization, which means there is no slack in the system to adjust or handle unplanned work (e.g. fix unexpected edge cases, improve readability of existing code)
* As utilization nears 100% then lead time trends towards infinity
* Measures must focus on outcomes, not outputs - avoid meaningless busy work

* Key metrics for measuring performance
  1. Delivery lead time
  2. Deployment frequency
  3. Time to restore service
  4. Change fail rate

* Delivery lead time
  * Lead Time is the amount of time between a customer making a request and a customer being satisfied.
    * Cycle Time is the amount of time between the work moving from In Progress to Done, which is a subset of Lead Time.
  * Lead Time is composed of both Discovery (i.e. figuring out how to satisfy the customer) and Delivery work (i.e. doing something to actually satisfy the customer).
  * Short Lead Time lets companies get feedback sooner if the customer was satisfied or not.

* Deployment frequency is a stand in for reduced batch size
  * A deployment is pushing code to production so that it is used by customers
  * A deployment may consist of multiple releases which are new features, changes, etc. deployed together to customers

* A common misconception is that moving faster must mean trade offs with these other metrics (e.g. "move fast and break things")
* High tempo comes from discipline around these metrics

* Working and delivering in small batches lets teams get customer feedback more frequently to ensure they are building the right thing.

* [Wardly Mapping](https://learnwardleymapping.com/)

* Make evidence based decisions to improve teams (e.g. does X improve, hinder, or maintain Y?)

* In learning cultures metrics help drive improvement, but in non-learning cultures they are used to control.

### Chapter 3: Measuring and Changing Culture

* Company culture has 3 levels:
  1. Basic Assumptions - Norms (very invisible, hard to put in writing)
  1. Values - Lense to interpret events
  1. Artifacts - Written mission statements, standard operating procedures, etc. (very visible)

* Good information flow is critical to successful companies
* Generative companies encourage collaboration through shared vision
* Burocrative companies encourage efficiency
* Trust is needed for open communication so problems are identified and solved quickly

* Change failure rate was not found to be valid in their construct so they excluded it from their analyses

* Who is on a team matters less than how a team works together
* Accidents are rarely one peron's fault: instead they are emergent from many actions taken by many different people, so, working together to create a big picture is important to avoid and or accidents.
* Human error should be a chance to improve how companies communicate.

### Chapter 4: Technical Practices

* Continously delivery
* Build quality in to eliminate the need for inspection
* Work in small batches with target outcomes / metrics
* Automate repetative work
* Relentlessly pursue continous improvement

* Goal of management is to make the above system-level outcomes extremely apparent

* Keep Git branches sort lived and merge into trunk frequently
* Write automated tests so engineers are confident in their changes
* Continously delivery so that it becomes non-event and not a special event

* If you want to improve culture do CICD because it is a shift in mindset

* Rework and un-planned work was significantly differnt between high and low performers indicating code quality is important to being effective

* Failure Demand: rework caused by not doing the right thing the first time.

* To be effective use ...
  * Version Control (e.g. GitHub)
  * Reliable Test Automation - flaky test erode trust
  * Test Data Management
  * Trunk Based Development - most branches live less than 1 day
    * Speculated multiple long-lived branches discourages refactoring and communication - people go live off in their own world for too long without feedback
  * Information Security
  * Continuous Delivery
    * Improve quality, culture, etc.

### Chapter 5: Architecture

* Architecture is an artifact of culture and can help, or more likely hinder, transformations / mindset shifts
* Focus on code deployablility and code testability to increase team performance
* Architecture should let teams work independently to build, test, and deploy changes without sign off, coordination, etc. from other teams because you want to minimize external dependencies
  * Architecture and teams should be loosely coupled
  * Teams must be cross functional so they can deliver work from design to deployment
* A good architecture will have teams talking about business solutions / outcomes and not tiny technical details
* Architecture enables company / team scaling because teams are decoupled from architecture to reorganize in whatever ways they need to
* Debugging somebody elses code is nearly impossible without tests
* Developer / Engineer Experience for testing is just as important as UX for any sort of product - if the tool sucks people won't use it.
* Focus on engineers (people) and outcomes; not tools and technologies.

### Chapter 6: Integrating Infosec into the Delivery Lifecycle

* Finger pointing is a sign the right people are not on the right team together - throwing stuff over a wall is not a good practice.
* Build important outcomes such as security, privacy, accessibility, etc. into the process starting from the first conversation around an idea

* Reference: [Rugged Manifesto](https://ruggedsoftware.org/)

### Chapter 7: Management Practices for Software

* LEAN Software development
  1. Limit work in progress
  2. Visually communicate the status of work, goals, and align everything with business outcomes
  3. Collect and use data to make day-to-day operating decisions

* Use a light weight change approval process such as team programming or code review internal to the team.
* Adding external required code reviews only slows down the work with no benefits - "risk security theory"

* Only let CICD Pipeline push code to production


### Chapter 8: Product Development

* Faux agile is common which unmasks itself as fixed budgets, large requirements docs, etc.
* Experimental approach to product development: learn, do, learn

* LEAN Product Development Practicies
  1. Slicing work into tiny batches that can be released within a week: including MVPs
  2. Teams understand how work flows from the business to customer and have visibility into this flow such as the status of new features
  3. Teams actively seek and incorporate customer feedback into products
  4. Do teams have authority to change product requirements without external approval

* Deploy tiny feature iterations quickly - avoid complex feature that take a long time to develop
* Must delight and engage customers
* If changes to requirements must be signed off then innovation is stunted
* Focus people around business outcomes so that they aren't going around doing random things

### Chapter 9: Making Work Sustainable

* "Deployment pain" (the fear engineers have pushing to production) explains disconnect between development practicies like testing and operational concerns used to maintain the product / keep the business going.
  * It works in development but not in production (e.g. polyfills)
* Where code deployments are the most painfull you will find the worst team performances

* Write tests
* Trunk based development
* CICD pipeline

* Ask "How painful are deployments?" to gain insight into how a team works

* Manual configurations are bad and lead to weird states across environments
* Ensure every environment can easily be reproduced

* Deployment pain leads to burnout
* To avoid burnout
  * Invest in employee development
  * Ask employees what is stoping them from achieving their objectives and then removing those obseicals
  * Give engineers time, space, and resources to experiment and learn
  * Employees must be given authority to make decisions that effect their work outcomes they are responsibile for
* Things that lead to burn out
  * Work overload
  * Lack of control
  * Insufficient awards
  * Break down of community
  * Lack of fairness
  * Culture mismatch

* Power orientated cultures lead to burn out because of blame instead of learning
* Invest in the skills of team members to avoid burn out
* Create environment that lets team members experiment, learn, and grow during work hours
* Every day lived values are what people use in their day to day - not aspirational values written on paper

### Chapter 10: Employee Satisfaction, Identity, and Engagement

* People are the heart of any transformation
* Higher performing employees have higher company loyalty
* NPS scores
  * 9 - 10: Promotos, they use and evagilize the product the lot (positive word of mouth)
  * 7 - 8: Passives, satisfied with product but will leave of something better comes along
  * 0 - 6: Detracters, defect quickly and hurt word of mouth
* Emloyees need to see and get bought into the end-to-end value stream to become strong promoters
* People are a companies greatest assets but are often seen as expendible
* Higher performing delivery cycles produce more employee satisfaction, company performance, and validates ideas faster in a circle: each feeding into the next
* Personal and company values leads to burnout
* Must institude a company culture of experimentation and learning
* People are best at creative tasks, computers are best at repeating tasks - ensure people are working on creative endeavours.
* Teams with more diversity work better; Teams must be inclusive before diversity can happen.

### Chapter 11: Leaders and Managers

* Leadership is not about reporting structures, leadership is about inspiring and motivating those around you.
  * Write good code
  * Architecture good systems
  * Achieve non-commercial and commercial goals
* Characteristics of transformational leader:
  * Clear Vision:  where the company is going and where it should be in 5 years
  * Inspirational communication: communicating in such a way that motivates even during uncertainty or changing environemtn
  * Intellectual stimulation: challenge followers to think of problems in new ways
  * Supportive leadership: demonstrates care and consideration of followers needs and feelings
  * Personal recognition: praises and awknoledges achievements of goals and improvements in work quality, personally commplements others when they do outstanding work
* Shared vision gets people aligned to move in the same collective direction
* Strong transofrmational leaders build and reenforce culture driving high performance teams
* Leaders cannot achieve goals on their own: they need followers which requires buy-in from followers.
* Make performance metrics visible so that teams can improve them (e.g. business metrics, ops metrics, deployment metrics, etc).
* Trust is built by acting predictiblely even during times of uncertainty.
* Build strong personal relationships between teams so that teams work effectively together
* Encourage sharing like lunch-and-learns
* Let engineers choose their tools

### Chapter 12: The science behind the book

* Primary research: collecting new data; secondary research: analyzing data already collected through primary research.
* Qualitative research: conversations, etc.; quantitative research: numbers, etc.
* Likert-like scales are cool
* Correlation is not causation, it is only an exploritory step
* State a hypothesis and collect data to disprove it; write a hypothesis based on some sort of hunch involving some sort of research
* Data in this book collected over a 4 years period

### Chapter 13: Intro to Psychometrics

* It is difficult to write unbiased questions
  * Leading questions
  * Loaded questions
  * Multiple questions in one
  * Unclear language
* We cannot measure latent variables directly, we must measure them indirectly through observable variables linked to latent variables.

* Good company cultures have:
  * High trust
  * Fosters information flow
  * Builds bridges across teams
  * Encourages novelty
  * Shares risks

* Good teams cultures have:
  * Information is actively sought
  * Messangers are not punished when they deliver bad news
  * Responsibilities are shared
  * Cross functional collaboration is encouraged and rewarded
  * Failure causes inquery
  * New ideas are welcomed
  * Failures are though of as opportunities to improve the system

### Chapter 14: Why use a survey?

* Surveys lets you analyze data quickly versus other methods like interviews which require much more clean up

* Periodic conversations around metrics is important, particularly if customers are reporting something different than what your metrics say.

* A system only has visibility into the things within it, to get a more wholistic picture you need to ask people working with those systems to know where the gaps are.
  * GitHub can only tell you how many files are tracked - not how many files are not tracked (unless your .gitignore is file-by-file which is unlikely)

* Humans make systems and humans can introduce errors into systems or humans can modify system data

* Survey's should be annonomous so that people respond honestly

### Chapter 15: The Data for the Project

* Targeted more a bigger group by ignoring questions about infastructure as code, etc. which many people may no be familiar with.
* Used questions that target latent variables, like using trunk based development to know if a company does CICD


### Chapter 16: High-Performance Leadership and Management

* We must not only build high performing teams but also products customers actually want which means buildings systems (e.g. teams) that get and react to feedback from multiple sources.

* High organizational performance
  * Profitability
  * Marketshare
  * Productivity

* Value streams enables the contiuous flow of customer value
* Each tribe delivers a portofilio of related products and services
* Each tribe is composed of multiple self-sterring teams called squads
* Each squad is responsibile for a distinct customer mission
* Each squad is lead by a product manager and tech lead with 2 pizza rule
* Each squad is a cross functional of engineers and marketers - BizDevOPs
* They use guilds
* They introduce product area leads to coordinate across squads

* Visualize problems, questions, work, etc. so that it is easy to see how it fits into the big picture

* Develop the people! For people to bring their best people need to know their leaders value them. Trust which is build through investing in that person to show you value the person and their long term contributions: not just the stuff they are getting out the door today.
* The work will change and people must be able to easily learn and adapt through investment by leadership.

* Psychological saftey is needed to have honest conversations to make improvements to the team / organization
* Quality is often overlooked for speed which is a difficult cycle to break without leadership buy-in
* Go deep before going wide - understand the details before scaling a new practice
* REF: Generative Leadership
* Storytelling is important but sometimes people need to learn something for themselves to make it stick
* Gather the right people to identify areas of improvements to have a diverse perspective; experiment and measure long term effects (e.g. was the improvement successful or only temporary?).

* When you change the way you work you change the routines which changes the culture
* To change the way you work you must be able to learn
* To be able to learn you must have a safe environment to do so

* How to change culture:
  * How do we learn how to learn?
  * How do I learn?
  * How can I make it safe for others to learn?
  * How can I learn from and with them?
  * How do we, together, establish new behaviors and new ways of thinking that build new habits and cultivate our new culture?
  * Where do we start?

* You cannot implement culture change. Trying to mimick another company's behavior is counter to generative culture.

* Suggestions to guide change:
  * Develop and maintain the right mindset about organizational learning
  * Make it your own
    * Don't look to copy others - experiment and learn what does and doesn't work from those others
    * Don't contract it out because then tribal knowledge and culture is lost long term
    * Do develop your own in-house coaches
  * Lead by example by changing the way that you work - don't expect others to change unless you also change
    * A generative culture starts through new behaviors
  * Practise discipline
  * Practice courage
  * Practice patience - the culture there today didn't happen over night so a new culture will take time to root and flower
  * Practice practice - learn, succeed, fail, learn, adjust, repeat (rythm and routine)


### Conclusion

* Delivering quality software at high tempo with stability is a market differentiator and key value driver for all sizes for companies
* You can't buy or copy high performance - you have to discover what works for you
