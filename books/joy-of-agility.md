  * Fanatical Focus: Don't try to be all things to all people
  * Stand for one distinctive thing that will give you a competative advantage.
  * The Fear of Positioning: Companies are often afraid to stand for one thing since that means not standing for multiple other things
  * To broaded your appeal, narrow your position.
* Author shifted focus from offering multiple product services to being "the XP consultancy": Industrial Logic's now single that was making them the most money.

* Organizations often suffer from too much buracracy which inhibit competition with more nimble competitors.
* Being agile lets people (and companies) simply adapt to the real environment in which the people are working in with little overhead.
* The market is real and ever changing - feedback is continuous. Burocracy inhibits response time to feedback - but not the feedback itself.

* Definition of agile: "marked by ready ability to move with quick easy grace" or "having a quick resourceful and adaptable character"
* Being agile is not about speed - being quick is not the same as being agile.
  * Agile is being graceful and ease.
* Being graceful is being agile.
* Agile is movement that is quick, effortless, balanced, and harmonious.
* Taking a long time to adapt to a new environment is not agile. Being agile is being able to adapt to new situations.
* Fear inhibits agility because of the hesitancy to act.
* You must study and practice agility to improve agility - much like a musical instrament.

* Six agile mantras (<https://waiyancan.com/summary-joy-of-agility-by-joshua-kerievsky/>)
  1. Be quick - but don't hurry: succeeed sooner via quickness undercontrol and avoid costly mistakes from hurrying or rushing.
  1. Be balanced and graceful: resolve imbalances, collaborate harmoniously with others, and make change empowering - not forced.
  1. Be poised to adapt: develop a readiness to revise and respond quickly and easily to change.
  1. Start minimal and evolve: being quicly and easily with something basic and rapidly improve it based on what you learn.
  1. Drive out fear: make safety a prerequisite to protect people and pave the way for high performance.
  1. Be readily resourceful: solve problems without hesitation by being quick, clever, and creative.

### Break on Through to the Agile Side

* The OREO superbowl tweet was a mix of having the right processes, the right people, and the right guardrailes to publish topical, timely, and on-brand content. This was not something that happened over night and was an iterative process that resulted in the OREO superbowl tweet "You can still dunk in the dark".
  * What companies were unable to captilize on such a shared cultural moment because of how their internal processes were structured?

* Condition of Uncertainty: "uncertainty is a situation where the decision-maker has very little information available about the alternatives. Which is not enough to take an action plan."
* Use experimental discovery process to experiment without fear of failure and chip away / remove uncertainty little by little through feedback.

* What product can you invent for your customers / target audience that will make thier jobs easy, simple, and graceful?
* An example is the self-sealing waterbaloon for summer parties to take the hassle of filling up and tieing each one individually.
* Help people/customers be agile by making them graceful.

* Users of a product can be internal or external. Collaborate with both throughout the entire discovery process. This means bringing front-line support staff into discovery discussion (e.g. reviewing designs mocks) to get feedback on tools they will (hopefully) be using in the near future.
* Prioritize worked based on key customer and business metrics. Don't be super rigid or analysis paralysis, but use those metrics to focus / add guardrales to the conversation and use best estimations around which ideas will best impact which key metrics.
* Close frequent collaboration increases agility.

* Traditions are hard to break.
* Don't just blindly follow tradition when learning a new skill. Explore alternatives and you may find something that is better and easier to use.

* Always consider 3 options before acting on something. One choice is no choice, two choices is a delema, and three choices offer new possibilities.
* To be agile, always consider at least 3 options.

* Use paired programming to accellerate onboarding.
* Use onboarding as an opportunity to demonstrate cultural values and technical practicies.
  * During first week, fix and deploy bug to learn how code and deployments work. Pair programming minimizes risk of something going wrong or people getting stuck.
* Drive out fear to enable agility for everyone, especially new hires.

* Handle change quickly by being graceful, resourceful, and adaptable.

* American Airlines matra is to "be the best at getting better" targeted at the core metrics outlined in Accelerate.
  * Deployment Frequency (DF)
  * Lead Time to Changes (LTTC)
  * Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
  * Change Failure Rate (CFR)
* Try to eliminate artifical bottlenecks to these metrics. For example, American Airlines completely rearchitected their self-serve kiosks and apps to make CICD easier and less time conusming. Changes in technology which had knock on effects to make the company more adaptable.
* Reduce whatever makes deployments slow, expensive, or awkward to invest in agility.

  * Find a way to stand out from the crowd - try not to make it mundane
  * Social currency to gain word of mouth
  * Leverage exclusivity to make in versus out groups
