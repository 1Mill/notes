## Notes

* Agility enables excellent by balancing resources and eliminating roadblocks

* Book Ref: [Selling the Invisible](https://www.amazon.com/Selling-Invisible-Harry-Beckwith-audiobook/dp/B001C1MT6O/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)
  * Fanatical Focus: Don't try to be all things to all people
  * Stand for one distinctive thing that will give you a competative advantage.
  * The Fear of Positioning: Companies are often afraid to stand for one thing since that means not standing for multiple other things
  * To broaded your appeal, narrow your position.
* Author shifted focus from offering multiple product services to being "the XP consultancy": Industrial Logic's now single that was making them the most money.

* Organizations often suffer from too much buracracy which inhibit competition with more nimble competitors.
* Being agile lets people (and companies) simply adapt to the real environment in which the people are working in with little overhead.
* The market is real and ever changing - feedback is continuous. Burocracy inhibits response time to feedback - but not the feedback itself.

* Definition of agile: "marked by ready ability to move with quick easy grace" or "having a quick resourceful and adaptable character"
* Being agile is not about speed - being quick is not the same as being agile.
  * Agile is being graceful and ease.
* Being graceful is being agile.
* Agile is movement that is quick, effortless, balanced, and harmonious.
* Taking a long time to adapt to a new environment is not agile. Being agile is being able to adapt to new situations.
* Fear inhibits agility because of the hesitancy to act.
* You must study and practice agility to improve agility - much like a musical instrament.

* Six agile mantras (<https://waiyancan.com/summary-joy-of-agility-by-joshua-kerievsky/>)
  1. Be quick - but don't hurry: succeeed sooner via quickness undercontrol and avoid costly mistakes from hurrying or rushing.
  1. Be balanced and graceful: resolve imbalances, collaborate harmoniously with others, and make change empowering - not forced.
  1. Be poised to adapt: develop a readiness to revise and respond quickly and easily to change.
  1. Start minimal and evolve: being quicly and easily with something basic and rapidly improve it based on what you learn.
  1. Drive out fear: make safety a prerequisite to protect people and pave the way for high performance.
  1. Be readily resourceful: solve problems without hesitation by being quick, clever, and creative.

### Break on Through to the Agile Side

* The OREO superbowl tweet was a mix of having the right processes, the right people, and the right guardrailes to publish topical, timely, and on-brand content. This was not something that happened over night and was an iterative process that resulted in the OREO superbowl tweet "You can still dunk in the dark".
  * What companies were unable to captilize on such a shared cultural moment because of how their internal processes were structured?

* Condition of Uncertainty: "uncertainty is a situation where the decision-maker has very little information available about the alternatives. Which is not enough to take an action plan."
* Use experimental discovery process to experiment without fear of failure and chip away / remove uncertainty little by little through feedback.

* What product can you invent for your customers / target audience that will make thier jobs easy, simple, and graceful?
* An example is the self-sealing waterbaloon for summer parties to take the hassle of filling up and tieing each one individually.
* Help people/customers be agile by making them graceful.

* Users of a product can be internal or external. Collaborate with both throughout the entire discovery process. This means bringing front-line support staff into discovery discussion (e.g. reviewing designs mocks) to get feedback on tools they will (hopefully) be using in the near future.
* Prioritize worked based on key customer and business metrics. Don't be super rigid or analysis paralysis, but use those metrics to focus / add guardrales to the conversation and use best estimations around which ideas will best impact which key metrics.
* Close frequent collaboration increases agility.

* Traditions are hard to break.
* Don't just blindly follow tradition when learning a new skill. Explore alternatives and you may find something that is better and easier to use.

* Always consider 3 options before acting on something. One choice is no choice, two choices is a delema, and three choices offer new possibilities.
* To be agile, always consider at least 3 options.

* Use paired programming to accellerate onboarding.
* Use onboarding as an opportunity to demonstrate cultural values and technical practicies.
  * During first week, fix and deploy bug to learn how code and deployments work. Pair programming minimizes risk of something going wrong or people getting stuck.
* Drive out fear to enable agility for everyone, especially new hires.

* Handle change quickly by being graceful, resourceful, and adaptable.

* American Airlines matra is to "be the best at getting better" targeted at the core metrics outlined in Accelerate.
  * Deployment Frequency (DF)
  * Lead Time to Changes (LTTC)
  * Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
  * Change Failure Rate (CFR)
* Try to eliminate artifical bottlenecks to these metrics. For example, American Airlines completely rearchitected their self-serve kiosks and apps to make CICD easier and less time conusming. Changes in technology which had knock on effects to make the company more adaptable.
* Reduce whatever makes deployments slow, expensive, or awkward to invest in agility.

* Reference book: [Contagious: Why things Catch On](https://www.amazon.com/Contagious-Jonah-Berger-audiobook/dp/B00B91I8IK/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)
  * Find a way to stand out from the crowd - try not to make it mundane
  * Social currency to gain word of mouth
  * Leverage exclusivity to make in versus out groups

### Be Quick - But Don't Hurry

* Agility isn't a mystery, it is a learned skill.
* Achieve a state of flow
* People adopt an avoidance for "speed" usually from managers / leaders pushing speed over quality or other traits. Strive to be graceful.

* If you hurry, you are more likely to make mistakes. But if you are not quick you won't get things done.
* Quickness without control does not produce champions.
* Too many risks can add up to too many costly mistakes unneededly.
* Quickness under control requires balance which starts with emotional, feeds into mental, and lastly feeds into physical balance.
* Activity without achievement.
* Learn quickness under control through deliberate practice.

* Chooing the path of least resistance may at first feel faster, but usually takes on some sort of debt (e.g. technical debt) that slows down the organization significantly in the future.
* Don't mistake being hasty with being agile.

* Very successful companies feel very laid back, not tinged with fear that comes with being late / behind on a project.
* People need to be able to reflect in order to innovate. Without time to do so (i.e. slack in the system) nothing changes - people are just go-go-go.
* **The overstressed organization focuses so much on trying to be efficient that it loses sight about how to be effective.**
* Be strategic about what to do, and merciless about what not to do.
* Develop a capacity for change.

* A true crasftsperson is not somebody who can create the finest works, but can create the finest works efficiently.
* Mastery includes speed, not just technique.

* Stop starting, start finishing - focus on done over started.
* Activity without achievement is keeping people busy without meaningful impacts on the business / customers.
* Relentless focus means saying no to something else.

* Chartering helps build alignment.
* Charters are collaborative from within the team, not dictated from management.
* Charter a vision, strategy, community, and working agreements to define shared person. This is a living document.
* Book Reference: [Liftoff: Start and Sustain Successful Agile Teams](https://www.amazon.com/Liftoff-Start-Sustain-Successful-Agile/dp/1680501631/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)

* Maximize the amount of work not done.
* When migrating a system, figure out what functionality is important to keep and what functionality is not important to keep.
* To increase agility, find the right work to do and maximize the amount of work not done.

* Feature Fakes: build fake features to collect product analytics / custoemr interest to then make informed decisions about customer value.
* Explore if something needs to be built before building it.

* Take small, iterative steps. Validating the expected behavior with each small step.
* Validate continousely.

* A siloed teams focuses on their own work and does not work gracefully with other teams.
* Cross silo-work means long hand-off processes which is waste.
* A balanced team can deliver value end-to-end.
* Stratagies to reduce waste
  1. Remove one slow hand-off at a time.
  1. Insource slow dependencies.
  1. Make the slowness visible.
  1. Limit work in process (focus on done over started)
* To fight siloed teams, experiment with innovation through isolation with buy-in to experiment with a new team outside of the traditional organizational structures already found in the org. This way change is isolated to this new team instead of trying to change how an old team already works.

* Do CICD to make deployments quick, simple, and safe through automation.
* Need zero-downtime deployments

* Proactively learn what is and isn't needed for success as soon as possible to reduce waste

* Have customer-centric metrics. A customer does not care about MMR, but they do care about the time to resolve their problem.
* Respond rapidly to people to build and maintain trust.

* Widsome of the crowd / crowd sourcing knowledge is a powerful tool.
* Avoid unnessesary rules, regulations, etc. to remain adaptable.

* Experiential learning accelerates learning

* Seek diverse opinions early and often.

* Learn (and likely fail) fast by validating ideas with cheap experiments.

### Be Balanced and Graceful

* Balance enables grace - flowing.

* The cause for most waste is doing things right in the conventional / traditional / existing system for how to do things. So waste is hard to realize at first.
  * Waiting for PR approval feels right, but can be eliminated through paired programming.
* Answer each of these questions as "yes" to achieve habitual excellence:
  1. Am I treated with respect and dignity every day, regardless of race, pay, gender, rank, etc.?
  1. Am I given the support, training, resources, etc. so that I can contribute to this organization in a way that brings meaning to my life?
  1. Am I recognized by somebody everyday whos judgement I value?
* Care deeply for people to achieve habitual excellence throughout the organization.

* Mixed messages deteriorate trust.
* Communication is not a finite, absolute thing. Assume any communication will be interpreted differently by another and may resulted in a mixed message.

* Care for people, use your heart, not your brain - employees, customers, etc.

* If not everybody is sharing equally in the work of the team, then the team is not in balance. Every person should be having equal contribution because that means each person trusts each other.
  * How frequently a team is passing the ball in Soccer - are there certain players getting the ball more than others and for that reasons?
  * Hero programmers versus teams.

* Throwing work over a wall rarely works - build communities / teams that can do both discovery and delivery work.

* If people do not feel safe to contribute their ideas to a community, you will never hear their ideas and so never hear divergent thinking.
* Try to be a facilitator to get other people to jump into the conversations and share their own ideas.
* How to create psyhologically safe meetings:
  1. C - Curious, caring, and opened minded
  1. L - Listen to one another
  1. E - Encourage everybody to contribute
  1. A - Avoid dominating and interupting
  1. R - Repeat and review people's points

* Interupting women in the business world is a common occurence which discourages speaking up and hearing new perspectives.
* Stop interupting people.

* Use failures as opportunities to learn and improve.
* Cultures with a focus on learning rather than assigning blame help focus people on solutions / improvement thinking instead of hiding mistakes.

* Make it safe to fail.
* Recognize and actively improve unsafe working conditions (e.g. being able to delete production datebase without much thought)
* Focus on improving the environment in which people are working rather than blaming people foreasy mistakes they make (rather easily) in the environment they are working in.

* Culture eats strategy for breakfast.
* Safey to fail means safey to learn, safey to innovate, and safey to create.
* Mistakes are the portal to discovery.

* Always give feedback gracefully. Perhaps outside of the office like on a walk.
* Do not avoid addressing behavior that inhibits the team's ability to collaborate. Sometimes this means difficult conversations about things people do, like picking their nose.

* **Tables can either foster or inhibit collaboration.**
* Make spaces collaborative by making conversations easy. If people can't see each other people will not work together. This is why I like my oval dinning room table - people rarely block each other's views unlike traditional rectangle tables.
* Never let a poorly designed space inhibit your collaboration - redesign the space!!!

* Assume innocence, avoid blame, and then move forward when actively sabbotaged.

* The team is the smallest unit of accountability - not individuals.
* Do not try to micromanage individuals.

* Three (more) agile mantras
  1. Start minimally and evolve.
  1. Be readily resourceful.
  1. Be balanced and graceful.
* Change by Attraction encourages incremental adoption and pushed through seeing what the future looks like instead of being told what the future will look like.
  * Change by choice versus decree.

### Be Poised to Adapt

* Be ready to act and move based on new information.
* Readiness to revise and respond before a new situation emerges.

* Daily committment to pursue excellent.

* Think through and actually test contingency plans in simulated (or safe but real) environments.
* Find opportunities to improve.

* You will have happier customers if you can adapt your product rapidly to their exact needs.

* The number of experiments per hour / day / month / year is (throught) to be linked to how successful a company will be long term.
* Must have a clear, valid hypothesis
* Make learning cheap and learn frequently.

* Create a safe and effective way to learn rapidly and frequently.

* Work items are assigned to the team, not individuals.
* Activity without achivement is not a way to improve
* Predicability is significantly less valuable than a committment to improve sprint to sprint through experiments.
* Balanced teams make being adaptive easier because all the knowledge needed to make a change resides within the team.

* The Build Trap: Buildling a product before validating it is feasible and desirable.
  * ["Building is the easy part of the product development process. Figuring out what to build and how we are going to build it is the hard part"](https://melissaperri.com/blog/2014/08/05/the-build-trap)
* Create cheap and quick ways to test your ideas

* To invent, you have to experiment.
* The size of your mistakes have to grow with the size of the company, otherwise things will stagnate.

* The ability to quash ideas based on title stagnates innovation.
* To enable innovation from anywhere, data driven decision making through metrics must be the norm - top to bottom.

* Make product ownership a team sport.
* Let teams generate, implement, release, and most importantly measure the impact of their ideas on customers.

* Tests are a saftey net that reduce change anxeity and deployment anxiety.

* Don't wait until something is finished to finally get feedback from customers, stakeholders, etc. Share and/or release frequently to get real meaningful feedback in order to learn and improve.

* If you don't know what your customers are actively doing and not doing with your product you may not know how you are failing your customer.
* Actively monitor usage of your product / service so you know how to adapt.

* Be a silent observer to how people are actively using your product and you will learn how to improve your product. What is obvious to you is often times not obvious to real customers.

* Bargain hunting: searching for low cost implementations for high value outcomes.
* Focus on value creation with rough estimates instead of sprint planning with rigid committments.
* Encourage frequent organic / just-in-time conversations
  * As an example, at Good Dog we articulated these as "decision points" where we would take a step back from doing and think about what is next. If this was a new business requirement, it is at these moments we would sync with our PO and scope out our next branch (e.g. answer questions, build alignment around functionality, etc.). I personally found this more efficient than waiting until pre-determined points in time (e.g. stand ups, planning, etc.) to have important conversations to keep the work flowing.
* Sprints are not vital to agility.

* Commit to a daily pursurt of excellence.
* Balanced teams to deliver value end-to-end without any external dependencies (e.g. another team).
* Make product ownership a team sport.
* Learn from real customers.
