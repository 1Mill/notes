## Notes

### Foreword

* Working as a PO for a larger company is about delivering value and managing politics to a larger extend then a startup which is more weighted towards delivering value.
* Low leverage (relationships, touch points) are what many bureaucratic cultures teach versus high leverage (results, capability) is what drives meaingful success.
* When presented with a problem, don't think first about "How do we do this", ask "Why do we need to do it at all?"
* "... effective engineering was not corelated with hours of effort ..."

### Introduction

* "The harder we worked, the more value we could produce, and the more likely it was that our startup would succeeed. Or so I thought."
* Work smarter, not harder: find the bets which require the least amount of effort believed to yield the most customer value.
* "Not all efforts, however well-intentioned, translate into impact."

* "Effective engineers ... get things done efficiently"
  * Recognize they don't have unlimited resource
  * Recgonize opportunities worth doing and those that are not
  * Work smarter, not harder
  * Focus on realistic value and impact for today
  * Avoid overengineering / optimizing for the future which doens't exist yet (e.g. infastructure which an scale to 100 million customers when you currently have 10 customers total)

### Part 1: Adopting the right mindset

#### Focus on high leverage activities

* Pair new hires with existing hires for 2-3 months to facilitate effective onboarding and learning of how the organization runs.
* Reoccuring Tech Talks + Codelabs (workshops + homework) to teach and validate comprehsion of core systems to grow collective understanding.

##### Use Leverage as your yardstick for effectiveness

* `Leverage = Impact Producted / Time Invested`
* Leverage is a way to measure Return on Investment (ROI)
* Time is the most valauble resource: it cann't be saved up or stored in reserve for the future like money, it is always being spent.
* Pareto Principle: 80% of the impact comes from 20% of the work
* Pairing programming, even just for 1 hour, is a high leverage activity
  * Share tooling knowledge to speed up other person (e.g. use script X to do Y)
  * Share business knowledge to spee up other person (e.g. avoid pitfall X)
  * Share technical knowlege to speed up other person (e.g. write code in X style)
* Pair programming is a minor investement to drive alignment and really onboard people quickly.
* Startup success depend more on the team then the capabilities of any one single person, so effective onboarding is a high leverage activity.

##### Increase your leverage in three ways

How to increase leverage:

1. By reduciing the time it takes to complete a certain activity (Woody Zuill: make the work easier)
2. By increasing the output of a particular activity (Woody Zuill: make the work effortless)
3. By shifting to higher-leverage activities (Woody Zuill: Make the work unnessesary)

Questions to increase leverage:

1. How can I complete this acivity in a shorter amount of time?
2. How can I increase the value prduced by this activity?
3. Is there something else that I could psend my time on that would poduce more value?

* Going through the motions does not mean value is being produced.

##### Direct Energy towards leverage oints, not just easy wins

* High leverage activities are not always quick easy wins, sometimes they require consistent effort over long periods of time to drive high leverage.

##### Key takeaways - part 1

* Use leverage to measure your engineering effectivness.
* Systemtically increase the leverage of your time.
* Focus your effort on leverage points.

#### Optimize for learning

* "Optimizing for learning is a high-leverage activity for the effective engineer ..."
* "... a growth mindset is a prerequisite for improving our abilities."

##### Adopt a growth mindset

* Connecting with others opens more opportunities than going alone.
* "... how we view our own effectiveness impacts how much effort we invest in improving it."
* "The students who were taught about the nature of intelligence and how it could be increased through experience and hard work saw their math grades improve over the year."
  * How can we incorporate such messaging into our team language?
* "own your story"
* Growth mindset: believe capabilities can improve; fixed indset: believe capabilities are fixed.
* "... [take] control of the parts of [your] story that [are] within [your] sphere of influence."
* "... optimize for exeprience where you learn rather than for experience where you effortlessly succeed."

##### Invest in your rate of learning

* Compound interst is a modern marvel
* Learning is compounding
  1. The more you learn today, the easier it is to learn new stuff more quickly tomorrow
  2. Invest in learning early - just like retirement
  3. Small deltas in personal learning lead to huge difference in the long run
* Reference: Delivering Happiness (Zappos CEO)
* Improving by 1% every day is a high leverage investment

##### Seek work environments conductive to learning

* When choosing a new job, look for
  1. Fast growth creates more opportunities to grow personally
  2. Training / effectove onboarding "... indicates the team prioritizes professional growth."
      * "What new things have team members learned recently?"
  3. Openness to continous improvement by seeking feedback
  4. Faster pace from idea to delivery gives you more opportunities to learn
  5. People around you are more important for learning than the work you end up doing
  6. Autonomy enables you to learn more quickly because you can choose the areas you want to learn more about rather than being assigned something.

##### Dedicate time on the job to develop new skills

* It is easy to fall into the Capability Trap because of all the work teams need to get done, so they are always trying to catch up: never improving or learning.
* Carve out 20% time to learn (Woody Zuill think it should be 50%) in 1-2 daily hour chunks
* Use team to learn more about the work
  * Improve at tooling
  * Improve understanding of domain
  * Improve at neighboring disciplines
* To get better at a skill, you need do to rote learning of the basics - you can't just jump into complex topics and expect to be efficient if you don't know the basics.
  * What the basics are change from discipline to discipline.
  * Reading about is not the same as skills in a skill, technique, etc.
* "... interleaved practice of different skills i more effective then repeated, massed practice of a single skill at prepairing people to tackle unfamiliar problems."
  * [Interleaved practice](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/effective-studying/other-learning-techniques.html#:~:text=Interleaved%20practice%20%E2%80%93%20when%20you%20are,B%20on%20the%20next%2C%20you): "when you are learning two or more related concepts or skills, instead of focusing exclusively on one concept or skill at a time, it can be helpful to alternate between them"
* "Create learning opportunities out of your 20% time ..."

##### Always be learning

* "... continual learning is injextricably linked with increased hapiness."
* Invest in these areas
  * Learning new programing languages or frameworks
  * Invest in skills thare are in high demand
  * Read books
  * Join a discussion group
  * Attend talks, conference, meetups
  * Biuld and mtain a strong network of relationships
  * Follow bloggers who teach
  * Write to teach
  * Tinker on the side
  * Pursue what you love.
* Reading book is a high leverage investment because you learn from others who already have the experience so you don't have to start from the ground up and rediscover the wheel.
* Networking creates more opportunities for lucky encounters

##### Key takeaways

* Own your story: focus on chages within your sphere of influence / control; don't spend too much energy on area's you can't control
* Don't shortchange your learning rate: the more you learn, the easier it is to learn more in the future; learning is compouding
* Find work environments that can sustain your growth
* Capitilize on opportunities to improve technical skills at work: learn from the best within the org.
* Locate learning opportunities outside of work: strive to become 1% better every day

#### Prioritize Regularly

* TODO
