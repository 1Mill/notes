## Notes

### Foreword

* Working as a PO for a larger company is about delivering value and managing politics to a larger extend then a startup which is more weighted towards delivering value.
* Low leverage (relationships, touch points) are what many bureaucratic cultures teach versus high leverage (results, capability) is what drives meaingful success.
* When presented with a problem, don't think first about "How do we do this", ask "Why do we need to do it at all?"
* "... effective engineering was not corelated with hours of effort ..."

### Introduction

* "The harder we worked, the more value we could produce, and the more likely it was that our startup would succeeed. Or so I thought."
* Work smarter, not harder: find the bets which require the least amount of effort believed to yield the most customer value.
* "Not all efforts, however well-intentioned, translate into impact."

* "Effective engineers ... get things done efficiently"
  * Recognize they don't have unlimited resource
  * Recgonize opportunities worth doing and those that are not
  * Work smarter, not harder
  * Focus on realistic value and impact for today
  * Avoid overengineering / optimizing for the future which doens't exist yet (e.g. infastructure which an scale to 100 million customers when you currently have 10 customers total)

### Part 1: Adopting the right mindset

#### Focus on high leverage activities

* Pair new hires with existing hires for 2-3 months to facilitate effective onboarding and learning of how the organization runs.
* Reoccuring Tech Talks + Codelabs (workshops + homework) to teach and validate comprehsion of core systems to grow collective understanding.

#### Use Leverage as your yardstick for effectiveness

* `Leverage = Impact Producted / Time Invested`
* Leverage is a way to measure Return on Investment (ROI)
* Time is the most valauble resource: it cann't be saved up or stored in reserve for the future like money, it is always being spent.
* Pareto Principle: 80% of the impact comes from 20% of the work
* Pairing programming, even just for 1 hour, is a high leverage activity
  * Share tooling knowledge to speed up other person (e.g. use script X to do Y)
  * Share business knowledge to spee up other person (e.g. avoid pitfall X)
  * Share technical knowlege to speed up other person (e.g. write code in X style)
* Pair programming is a minor investement to drive alignment and really onboard people quickly.
* Startup success depend more on the team then the capabilities of any one single person, so effective onboarding is a high leverage activity.

#### Increase your leverage in three ways

How to increase leverage:
1. By reduciing the time it takes to complete a certain activity (Woody Zuill: make the work easier)
2. By increasing the output of a particular activity (Woody Zuill: make the work effortless)
3. By shifting to higher-leverage activities (Woody Zuill: Make the work unnessesary)

Questions to increase leverage:
1. How can I complete this acivity in a shorter amount of time?
2. How can I increase the value prduced by this activity?
3. Is there something else that I could psend my time on that would poduce more value?

* Going through the motions does not mean value is being produced.

#### Direct Energy towards leverage oints, not just easy wins

* High leverage activities are not always quick easy wins, sometimes they require consistent effort over long periods of time to drive high leverage.

#### Key takeaways - part 1

* Use leverage to measure your engineering effectivness.
* Systemtically increase the leverage of your time.
* Focus your effort on leverage points.
