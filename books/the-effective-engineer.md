### Foreword

* Working as a PO for a larger company is about delivering value and managing politics to a larger extend then a startup which is more weighted towards delivering value.
* Low leverage (relationships, touch points) are what many bureaucratic cultures teach versus high leverage (results, capability) is what drives meaingful success.
* When presented with a problem, don't think first about "How do we do this", ask "Why do we need to do it at all?"
* "... effective engineering was not corelated with hours of effort ..."

### Introduction

* "The harder we worked, the more value we could produce, and the more likely it was that our startup would succeeed. Or so I thought."
* Work smarter, not harder: find the bets which require the least amount of effort believed to yield the most customer value.
* "Not all efforts, however well-intentioned, translate into impact."

* "Effective engineers ... get things done efficiently"

  * Work smarter, not harder
