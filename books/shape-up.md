# Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters (v1.8, 2019 edition)

<https://basecamp.com/shapeup>

## Key takways

* Basecamp operates on a 6 week delivery cycle. If a `bet` cannot be delivered within 6 weeks the `bet` is not prioritized. Not fitting into the 6 week window means either (a) the `bet` is to big or (b) there are to many unanswered questions. Both mean the `bet` is too risky.

* If a project is in-progress but isn't finished in that 6 week window, it is stopped. This avoids sunk-cost fallacy. Which avoids burdening the organization (and team) with a potentially never ending project. This project can go back to the shaping phase.

* Basecamps is composed of multiple compartmentalized shaper (i.e. discovery) teams and delivery teams. A shaper team comes up with, evaluates, and produces sketches to produce a bet. Bets are projects that can be finished in 6 weeks. Delivery teams take up and deliver bets in that 6 week period.

* Basecamp is composed of multiple compartmentalized shaper (i.e. discovery) teams and delivery teams. A shaper team discoveres, evaluates, and roughly sketches out a bet to a business opportunity / problem. A delivery team takes up bets and outputs product features.

* Shaping is "done" when (1) the "baseline" (i.e. root customer problem) is discovered from one or many "raw ideas" (e.g. customer feedback) and then (2) "batched" into a solution that can be delivered in 6 or less weeks by one designer and one to two engineers.

## Notes

### Introduction

* Culture is foundational to flow.
* Doing something the wrong way works in the short term, but destroys team morale.

* As companies grow, information slips through the cracks because not everybody is involved in every conversation traditionally.
* Breadboarding?
* Scope mapping?
* "We needed language to describe what we were doing and more structure to keep doing it at our new scale."
* 6 week cycles
* Shaping: "up-front design work we did to set boundaries and reduce risks on projects before we committed them to teams."

* 6 week cycles
  * Anything worth doing can be scoped to 6 weeks of work.
  * Deadline is top of mind to keep focus on the most valuable deliverables.
  * No traditional SCRUM events (e.g. standups, etc.)

* Shaping the work
  * Projects are bets
  * Small senior group figoure out rough solution to scope feasability to fit in that 6 week cycle
  * "Projects are defined at the right level of abstraction: concrete enough that the teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that they have room to work out the interesting details themselves."
  * Answer: "How much time do we want to spend? How much is this idea worth?"

* Making teams responsible
  * Give full responsibility to the people delivering the solution.
  * Requires less micromanagement
  * Senior people focus on figuring out the next opportunity to bet on
  * Better shaped projects set clear boundaries / goals so teams have the relevant information they need to make auntonoumus decisions. They don't need sign off.

* Targeting risk
  * Book: Competing against luck
  * Avoid getting shackled to the past - tomorrow (i.e. the next 6 week cycle) should be focusing on something new.
  * Only bet on 6 week cycles: do not hope or plan for a project to go past 6 weeks.
  * Resolve open questions or dependencies
  * If a project runs over 6 weeks, kill it. Avoid sunk cost fallacy for something. Then, rethink the scope / intent of the project if it is still valuable for some future cycle.
  * One product team of engineers, designers, etc. that all focus on the same mission. Group people by passion and ability: not just ability.
  * Start with the most unknown or risky work.
  * Deploy often

### Principles of shaping

* Something is shaped when it is a good balance between abstract and concrete.
  * Translated to Opportunity Solutions Trees, this seems like finding clear opportunities that impact business outcomes. But leave the experimentation / solutions to the delivery team.
* Design too early is too concrete that biases implementation and limits innovation.
  * When scope is not clearly communicated as variable, artifacts like wireframes cause teams to deliver exactly what is handed to them. Even if this means lots of work for little customer value.
  * Rough sketches to facilitate conversations is as concrete as needed.
* Don't be too abstract, boundaries need to be given to communicate buisness context to the team if they do not have it.
  * "We'll know it when we see it" is not meaningful
  * Too abstract projects usually grown in scope because of all the shots in the dark
* 6 week cycles naturally scope down work to the must-haves, not the should or could haves that 'feel' like must haves
  * If they are still important from customer feedback after the must haves, you can always iterate later.
* Properties of shaped work
  * It is rough
  * It is thought through - big picture concepts are present, no open questions
  * It is bounded - team know where to stop
* A group of 2-3 people should shape a project that cover the entire lifecycle from business, technology, and design
* "[Shaping] defines what the feature does, how it works, and where it fits into existing flows"
* Basecamp uses "Appetite" as a synonym for "scope"
* Answer the questions:
  * What are we trying to solve?
  * Why does it matter?
  * What counts as success?
  * Which customers are affected?
  * What is the cost of doing this instead of something else?
* Do not shape by committee - keep the process agile
* Two tracks: shaping work and building work
  * Akin to duel track agile or product trio
* Shaping and delivery work are compartmentalize.
  * Shaping not shared with deliveries until prioritized / bet on
* Steps to shaping
    1. Set boundaries
    2. Rough elements - usually sketches
    3. Address risks and rabit holes
    4. Write a "pitch" to place on the "betting table"

### Settings Boundaries for shaping

* All shaping sessions need to start with a "raw idea" (e.g. customers are asking for X) with no pretense.
* "Raw ideas" need to be aligned with business outcomes.
* A "batch" is a "raw idea" that is shaped.
* An "appetite" is compose of one or more "batches" that fit into a 6 week delivery cycle for a team of 1 designer and 1 or 2 engineers.
* If a "batch" cannot fit into that 6 week mark, then cut scope or slice an independently releasable chunk off that can be delivered within that time frame.
* Use "Fixed time, varaible scope" philosophy to keep focus on the most important work.
* "Without a time limit, there's always a better version. ... But when you're hungry and in a hurry, a hot dog is perfect."
* Raw ideas are exciting but keep a poker face and do not commit excitedly or begrugenly until you understand the idea.
* Narrow down the problem to solve the root issue. Do not just accept the "raw idea" at face value.
* A "baseline" is a specific problem a customer is trying to solve and is usually the root of a "raw idea" .
* If an idea is too vauge / large to work on after researching it, punt on it until other examples come up to provide more context and discover the "baseline".
* Shaping is done when (1) a "baseline" is discovered and (2) it is "batched" into a sketched solution.

### Finding the elements

* Only work with highly trusted partners or nobody at all to brainstorm ideas quickly.
* Right level of high level details: "fat marker sketches"
* Three basics to draw:
  1. Places - the where in the product
  2. Affordances - the how in the product
  3. Connecting lines - the effect in the product
* Breadboarding sounds extremely similar to [Event Storming](https://wiki.prooph-board.com/event_storming/what-is-event-storming.html)
* UI elements are the expected output from this brainstorming session
* The purpose of this step is to try make a "raw idea" actionable - but does not mean the company is committed to acting on this bet
*

### Risks and Rabbit Holes

* Can't predict unknowns unknowns but can try and tackle known unknowns in shaping before diving into doing to reduce risk of wasted.
* Try to shape projects to be made of "independent, well-understood parts that assemble together in known ways."
* Discovery during the delivery process can add days of work (i.e. should I design this like this or that?) - this makes it easy to creep over the 6 week timebox
* Scope Hammering: "Forcefully questioning a design, implementation, or use case to cut scope and finish inside the fixed time box."
* Define a things-we-are-not-doing section to keep the work focused called "out of bounds"
* Friendly-Conspiratorial Mood: "Here's something I'm thinking about... but I'm not ready to show anybody yet... what do you think?"
* Asking "Is this possible?" and "Is this possible in 6 weeks?" are significantly different questions
* Betting Table: "A meeting during cool-down when stakeholders decide which pitches to bet on in the next cycle."

### Writing the Pitch

* 5 ingredients to always include in a pitch:
  1. Problem - the `raw idea` or a motiviation for change
      * Make this a single specific story to "show why the status quo doesn't work"
  2. Appetite - time box and constraints on the solution from that time box
  3. Solution - core elements immediately easy for people to understand
  4. Rabbit Holes - pitfalls worth calling out to avoid problems
  5. No gos - things that will be intentionally not done to fit the time box
  6. Bonus (optional) - if this bet works, what are future raw ideas?

* Teams cann't compair solutions without a shared understanding of the problem trying to be solved - align on the problem before diving into solutions.
* Baseline: What customers are doing without the thing we're currently building
* Visuals helps communicate ideas / solutions
  * Turn abstract solutions into fat marker sketches to help communicate the main story
  * Annotate fat marker sketches to start conversations around key interactions and their effects

* Once a pitch is written and before bringing it to the betting table create a public (to the company) RFC to gather more feedback.

### Bets, Not Backlogs

* Every pitch written in the last 6 weeks is put onto the `betting table` as a `bet`.
* If a `bet` is picked up it immediately start getting worked on
* If a `bet` is not picked up it is immediately deleted - not put into a backlog, etc. as a historical artifact
* Each individual can track deleted bets as they see fit but nothing is kept in a backlog that must be managed over multiple cycles
  * Everything is just in time - no stale ideas sitting around for 123+ years
* Informal conversations driven by 1-1s help generate `raw ideas` and `friendly conspiritors` to brainstorm solutions
* "Important ideas come back" - can't say this enough!!!!!!
* "If you hear it once and never again, maybe it wasn't really a problem."

### The Betting Table

* Having every person work on the same cycle (1) standardizes project sizes and (2) simplifies when people will be available.
* 2 week cycles are too short to meaningfully deliver something of value and introduce much administrative overhead and frequently breaking flow
* Cool Down Period: "A two-week break between cycles to do ad-hoc tasks, fix bugs, and hold a betting table"
* Big Batch Team: A team that works on "one project that occupies a team for a whole cycle and ships at the end"
* Small Batch Team: A team that works on "a set of 1-2 week projects that a single team ships by the end of the six week cycle"
* A betting table meeting is held during the cool down period to kick off the next cycle.
* A bettle table at Basecamp consists of the CEO, CTO, a senior engineer, and a product strategiest.
* Take the [zero bugs approach](https://www.xolv.io/blog/articles/zero-bug-software-development/) to prevent cycle interuptions that kill flow
* Circut Breaker: "A risk management technique: Cancel projects that don't ship in one cycle by default instead of extending them by default"
  * Projects that go on for too long now usually block more valuable work from happening later
  * If used, means something missing from the shaping sessions.
  * Encourages teams to consistently reevaluate scope
* Schedule a "bug smash cycle" during a low priority time of the year like December which is frequently interupted by holidays
* Always start each cycle with a clean slate: put everything through the betting table to ensure it aligns with the business today and not some old snapshot
* Shape and scope all work down to the cycle time: spit multi-cycle projects into multiple bets for different cycles. If the first cycle fails you can easily pivot.

### Place Yours Bets

* At the betting table this is when teams will be assigned bets
* This is an opportunity to re-organize teams / people for new bets
* Some companies let people self-select which bet they work on versus being assigned a bet

* Types of bets
  * Adding to an existing product (usually a single cycle)
    * "Done" is it is in the hands of customers
  * Research and development mode (usually multiple cycles)
    * Usually composed of senior engineers, designers, etc. to setup a foundation for a new product
    * Spike on something new
    * "Done" is finding a way forward
  * Production mode
    * Building a new product (usually multiple cycles)
    * "Done" is getting the product ready for customers to use
  * Cleanup mode
    * Clean up code, handle edge cases, etc. similar to a "bug smash cycle" before "launch" of a new product
    * No formal shaping
    * Clean up should never be longer than 2 cycles
    * "Done" is getting the product ready for customers to use

* Choosing the right bets
  * Does the problem matter?
  * Is bet A more or less valuable than bet B?
  * Is the appetite right?
  * Is the solution attractive? - only spend a moment in the weeds, otherwise keep it high level
  * Is this the right time?
  * Are the right people available? - account for vacations, etc.

* Send a kick-off message detailing which bets are being worked on in the next cycle

### Hand Over Responsibility

* Break down the work as a team to keep the "whole" intact
* Testing and QA must happen within the cycle time: not after.
* The first 3 days of a cycle are just learning the lay of the land and how that impacts scope - longer than 3 days may be a sign of a problem
* Different between imagened and discovered / real tasks once teams start digging into the code.
  * Sounds like a good case for Discovery Trees

### Get One Piece Done

* Do [vertical feature slicing](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.2-chapter-11)
* Work as a team - avoid hand offs because they can cause a huge amount of waste from miscommunication
* The first peice of work should be (1) core, (2) small and (3) novel; if multiple slices are tied start with the most uncertain.

### Map the Scopes

* Make themse of work visible after the domain is understood - something stakeholders can understand
  * Use Discovery Trees
  * Use Event Storming
* Scope mappings "reflect the real ground truth of what can be done independently - the underlying interdependencies and relationships in the problem"
* Nomenclature emerges organically from scope mapping to make conversations flow more easily
* Scopes should be remapped when either
  1. "Done" is not clear
  1. The nomenclature is not unique
  1. Feature slicing doesn't appear to be working
* Iceberg-ing where one part of the code feels like it will be too complicated. Try and re-think implementation / domains.
* Use symbols to communicate must-have versus nice-to-haves
  * `(empty space)` - Must have
  * `~` - Nice to have
  * Can likely expend to MoSCoW

### Show Progress

* Use Discovery Trees to visualize the work and communicate to managers what is known versus what is unknown
* All work follows a hill like pattern: discovery (upward slope) and delivery (downward slope)
  * Discovering the code, requirements, etc
  * Delivering working software
* Knowing where a team is at on this slope is more a feeling
* [Hill Charts](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.4-chapter-13#status-without-asking) help communicate where each feature slice to stakeholders
  * If a dot doesn't move for a while may be an opportunity to remap the scope / break it into smaller feature slices that can be independently tracked

### Decide When to Stop

* "Okay, this isn't perfect, but it definitely works and customers will feel like this is a big improvement for them."
* Don't compair up to what could be prefect in an ideal world, instead compair down to real baseline
* Be picky about scope to stay competative in the market
* Write tests to ensure core functionality works as expected and continues to work as expected

* When to extend a project
  1. It contains "must haves" that cannot be "scope hammered"
  2. All work must be "downhill" meaning there is no known unknowns to finishing the work
* Sometimes last "must haves" can be finished during the cool down period, but if this happens regularly it is a red flag that the shaping process is not working well enough

### Move On

* Avoid knee-jerk reactions to immediate customer feedback from a recent change - save it for a new bet; keep a clean slate for the next cycle.
* Saying "yes" to something limits your freedom - saying "no" keeps your options open


### Conclusion +

* Focus on making product delivery simple before focusing on improving the discovery pipeline.
  * Generating ideas is easy but deploying value is more difficult
  * Make sure you can deliver the ideas that are already generated
  * Focus on done over started
* Worring about maximizing utilization by having a designer sit idle is inconsequential to them being ready to immediately provide feedback as soon as an engineer is done with the frontend code to keep the work flowing
  * Something done is more important than max utilization of a single person
  * Focus on macro, not micro
* <https://basecamp.com/shapeup/4.5-appendix-06>
  * Appetite: "The amount of time we want to spend on a project, as opposed to an estimate."
  * Time horizon: "The longest period of time where we can feel a deadline pushing on us from the beginning. Six weeks."
