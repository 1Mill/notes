# Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters (v1.8, 2019 edition)

<https://basecamp.com/shapeup>

## Key takways

* Basecamp operates on a 6 week delivery cycle. If a project cannot be delivered within 6 weeks the project is not prioritized. Not fitting into the 6 week window means either (a) the project is to big or (b) there are to many unanswered questions. Both mean the project is too risky.

* If a project is in-progress but isn't finished in that 6 week window, it is stopped. This avoids sunk-cost fallacy. Which avoids burdening the organization (and team) with a potentially never ending project. This project can go back to the shaping phase.

* Basecamps is composed of multiple compartmentalized shaper (i.e. discovery) teams and delivery teams. A shaper team comes up with, evaluates, and produces sketches to produce a bet. Bets are projects that can be finished in 6 weeks. Delivery teams take up and deliver bets in that 6 week period.

* Basecamp is composed of multiple compartmentalized shaper (i.e. discovery) teams and delivery teams. A shaper team discoveres, evaluates, and roughly sketches out a bet to a business opportunity / problem. A delivery team takes up bets and outputs product features.

* Shaping is "done" when (1) the "baseline" (i.e. root customer problem) is discovered from one or many "raw ideas" (e.g. customer feedback) and then (2) "batched" into a solution that can be delivered in 6 or less weeks by one designer and one to two engineers.

## Notes

### Introduction

* Culture is foundational to flow.
* Doing something the wrong way works in the short term, but destroys team morale.

* As companies grow, information slips through the cracks because not everybody is involved in every conversation traditionally.
* Breadboarding?
* Scope mapping?
* "We needed language to describe what we were doing and more structure to keep doing it at our new scale."
* 6 week cycles
* Shaping: "up-front design work we did to set boundaries and reduce risks on projects before we committed them to teams."

* 6 week cycles
  * Anything worth doing can be scoped to 6 weeks of work.
  * Deadline is top of mind to keep focus on the most valuable deliverables.
  * No traditional SCRUM events (e.g. standups, etc.)

* Shaping the work
  * Projects are bets
  * Small senior group figoure out rough solution to scope feasability to fit in that 6 week cycle
  * "Projects are defined at the right level of abstraction: concrete enough that the teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that they have room to work out the interesting details themselves."
  * Answer: "How much time do we want to spend? How much is this idea worth?"

* Making teams responsible
  * Give full responsibility to the people delivering the solution.
  * Requires less micromanagement
  * Senior people focus on figuring out the next opportunity to bet on
  * Better shaped projects set clear boundaries / goals so teams have the relevant information they need to make auntonoumus decisions. They don't need sign off.

* Targeting risk
  * Book: Competing against luck
  * Avoid getting shackled to the past - tomorrow (i.e. the next 6 week cycle) should be focusing on something new.
  * Only bet on 6 week cycles: do not hope or plan for a project to go past 6 weeks.
  * Resolve open questions or dependencies
  * If a project runs over 6 weeks, kill it. Avoid sunk cost fallacy for something. Then, rethink the scope / intent of the project if it is still valuable for some future cycle.
  * One product team of engineers, designers, etc. that all focus on the same mission. Group people by passion and ability: not just ability.
  * Start with the most unknown or risky work.
  * Deploy often

### Principles of shaping

* Something is shaped when it is a good balance between abstract and concrete.
  * Translated to Opportunity Solutions Trees, this seems like finding clear opportunities that impact business outcomes. But leave the experimentation / solutions to the delivery team.
* Design too early is too concrete that biases implementation and limits innovation.
  * When scope is not clearly communicated as variable, artifacts like wireframes cause teams to deliver exactly what is handed to them. Even if this means lots of work for little customer value.
  * Rough sketches to facilitate conversations is as concrete as needed.
* Don't be too abstract, boundaries need to be given to communicate buisness context to the team if they do not have it.
  * "We'll know it when we see it" is not meaningful
  * Too abstract projects usually grown in scope because of all the shots in the dark
* 6 week cycles naturally scope down work to the must-haves, not the should or could haves that 'feel' like must haves
  * If they are still important from customer feedback after the must haves, you can always iterate later.
* Properties of shaped work
  * It is rough
  * It is thought through - big picture concepts are present, no open questions
  * It is bounded - team know where to stop
* A group of 2-3 people should shape a project that cover the entire lifecycle from business, technology, and design
* "[Shaping] defines what the feature does, how it works, and where it fits into existing flows"
* Basecamp uses "Appetite" as a synonym for "scope"
* Answer the questions:
  * What are we trying to solve?
  * Why does it matter?
  * What counts as success?
  * Which customers are affected?
  * What is the cost of doing this instead of something else?
* Do not shape by committee - keep the process agile
* Two tracks: shaping work and building work
  * Akin to duel track agile or product trio
* Shaping and delivery work are compartmentalize.
  * Shaping not shared with deliveries until prioritized / bet on
* Steps to shaping
    1. Set boundaries
    2. Rough elements - usually sketches
    3. Address risks and rabit holes
    4. Write a "pitch" to place on the "betting table"

### Settings Boundaries for shaping

* All shaping sessions need to start with a "raw idea" (e.g. customers are asking for X) with no pretense.
* "Raw ideas" need to be aligned with business outcomes.
* A "batch" is a "raw idea" that is shaped.
* An "appetite" is compose of one or more "batches" that fit into a 6 week delivery cycle for a team of 1 designer and 1 or 2 engineers.
* If a "batch" cannot fit into that 6 week mark, then cut scope or slice an independently releasable chunk off that can be delivered within that time frame.
* Use "Fixed time, varaible scope" philosophy to keep focus on the most important work.
* "Without a time limit, there's always a better version. ... But when you're hungry and in a hurry, a hot dog is perfect."
* Raw ideas are exciting but keep a poker face and do not commit excitedly or begrugenly until you understand the idea.
* Narrow down the problem to solve the root issue. Do not just accept the "raw idea" at face value.
* A "baseline" is a specific problem a customer is trying to solve and is usually the root of a "raw idea" .
* If an idea is too vauge / large to work on after researching it, punt on it until other examples come up to provide more context and discover the "baseline".
* Shaping is done when (1) a "baseline" is discovered and (2) it is "batched" into a sketched solution.

### Finding the elements

* Only work with highly trusted partners or nobody at all to brainstorm ideas quickly.
* Right level of high level details: "fat marker sketches"
* Three basics to draw:
  1. Places - the where in the product
  2. Affordances - the how in the product
  3. Connecting lines - the effect in the product
* Breadboarding sounds extremely similar to [Event Storming](https://wiki.prooph-board.com/event_storming/what-is-event-storming.html)
* UI elements are the expected output from this brainstorming session
* The purpose of this step is to try make a "raw idea" actionable - but does not mean the company is committed to acting on this bet
*

### Risks and Rabbit Holes

* Can't predict unknowns unknowns but can try and tackle known unknowns in shaping before diving into doing to reduce risk of wasted.
* Try to shape projects to be made of "independent, well-understood parts that assemble together in known ways."
* Discovery during the delivery process can add days of work (i.e. should I design this like this or that?) - this makes it easy to creep over the 6 week timebox
* Scope Hammering: "Forcefully questioning a design, implementation, or use case to cut scope and finish inside the fixed time box."
* Define a things-we-are-not-doing section to keep the work focused called "out of bounds"
* Friendly-Conspiratorial Mood: "Here's something I'm thinking about... but I'm not ready to show anybody yet... what do you think?"
* Asking "Is this possible?" and "Is this possible in 6 weeks?" are significantly different questions
* Betting Table: "A meeting during cool-down when stakeholders decide which pitches to bet on in the next cycle."

### Writing the Pitch

* 5 ingredients to always include in a pitch:
  1. Problem - the `raw idea` or a motiviation for change
      * Make this a single specific story to "show why the status quo doesn't work"
  2. Appetite - time box and constraints on the solution from that time box
  3. Solution - core elements immediately easy for people to understand
  4. Rabbit Holes - pitfalls worth calling out to avoid problems
  5. No gos - things that will be intentionally not done to fit the time box
  6. Bonus (optional) - if this bet works, what are future raw ideas?

* Teams cann't compair solutions without a shared understanding of the problem trying to be solved - align on the problem before diving into solutions.
* Baseline: What customers are doing without the thing we're currently building
* Visuals helps communicate ideas / solutions
  * Turn abstract solutions into fat marker sketches to help communicate the main story
  * Annotate fat marker sketches to start conversations around key interactions and their effects

* Once a pitch is written and before bringing it to the betting table create a public (to the company) RFC to gather more feedback.

### Bets, Not Backlogs

* Every pitch written in the last 6 weeks is put onto the `betting table` as a `bet`.
* If a `bet` is picked up it immediately start getting worked on
* If a `bet` is not picked up it is immediately deleted - not put into a backlog, etc. as a historical artifact
* Each individual can track deleted bets as they see fit but nothing is kept in a backlog that must be managed over multiple cycles
  * Everything is just in time - no stale ideas sitting around for 123+ years
* Informal conversations driven by 1-1s help generate `raw ideas` and `friendly conspiritors` to brainstorm solutions
* "Important ideas come back" - can't say this enough!!!!!!
* "If you hear it once and never again, maybe it wasn't really a problem."
