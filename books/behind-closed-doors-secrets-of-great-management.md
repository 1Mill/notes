## Notes

### Preface

* "Poor managers create the illusion of productivity through busy-ness. Average managers finish work (not not always the right work). Great managers accomplish goals and develop people."
* Great managers great space for people to grow and be leaders
* Being a great manager requires being a leader, but being a leader does not require being in management.

### Introduction

* Managers amplify the work of others - so bad managers often have unrealized productivity.
* People often leave bad managers, churning highly productive or highly motivated workers while keeping the rest.

### Week one - Learning about the people and the work

* 3 things to figure out immediately
    1. Who the people are - their strengths and interests - and what they are working one
    2. The stated mission of the group and how the group provides value
    3. How your group fits into the larger organization

* Figure out who wants to be on what track (e.g. process, technical, management) and who is busy with what work for what goals.

* One on ones
  * Meet weekly
  * Meet regularly
  * Have a format
  * Be prepaired
  * Be adaptable
  * Be respectful

* People are non-fungible despite what budgets would like you to feel.
* Establish office-hours to create opportunities for others to drop in who you don't regularly meet with. Or for your team to meet with you outside of normal 1-1 hours.

* Don't offer help if you can't deliver. And if you do, be sure to follow through.

* Make work visible so it can be managed - not hidden and unmanaged.
