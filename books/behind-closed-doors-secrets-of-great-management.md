## Notes

### Preface

* "Poor managers create the illusion of productivity through busy-ness. Average managers finish work (not not always the right work). Great managers accomplish goals and develop people."
* Great managers great space for people to grow and be leaders
* Being a great manager requires being a leader, but being a leader does not require being in management.

### Introduction

* Managers amplify the work of others - so bad managers often have unrealized productivity.
* People often leave bad managers, churning highly productive or highly motivated workers while keeping the rest.

### Week one - Learning about the people and the work

* 3 things to figure out immediately
    1. Who the people are - their strengths and interests - and what they are working one
    2. The stated mission of the group and how the group provides value
    3. How your group fits into the larger organization

* Figure out who wants to be on what track (e.g. process, technical, management) and who is busy with what work for what goals.

* One on ones
  * Meet weekly
  * Meet regularly
  * Have a format
  * Be prepaired
  * Be adaptable
  * Be respectful

* People are non-fungible despite what budgets would like you to feel.
* Establish office-hours to create opportunities for others to drop in who you don't regularly meet with. Or for your team to meet with you outside of normal 1-1 hours.

* Don't offer help if you can't deliver. And if you do, be sure to follow through.

* Make work visible so it can be managed - not hidden and unmanaged.

* Multitaksing wastes mental cycles.
* Multitasking feels more productivty because it maximizes uitilization but it does not eliminate the real waste: waiting - so cycle time remains the same if over opptimistically nothing goes wrong.

* Know how to track and have insights into what people are really working on
  * Assigned project work
  * Ad hoc work (assigned or unassigned)
  * Recurring work - work which needs to be constantly monitored and/or done and/or maintained
  * Periodic work - work which needs to be done at regular business intervals

* Make all the work visible, iterate, and seek to understand resistance.

### Week two - Bringing order to the chaos

* There is always more work than can be done - set clear priorities and clearly communicate what you are and are not working on.

* Make guiding principle and/or company goals visible and reiterate them frequently.

* "Focus on the funded work" and be sure to be able to justify and explain your reasoning.

* With recurring or period work, make sure the work is still valuable and has a clear owner seeking that work to be done. Otherwise, eliminate it.

* Categorize all projects
  * Projects you will continue
  * Projects you need to stop (e.g. provides not value to anybody anymore)
  * Projects that may be important so you can transition it to a new group with more aligned goals.

* People take a winding path throughou their careers, often cycling between IC and manager depending on the org and work to be done.
