# An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Software Engineering Management

* Manager should support at most 6 - 8 engineers
* **Keep innovation and technical debt (e.g. bugs) as 1 team**
  * Avoid 2 teired system by keeping innovationg and learning in the same team
* High performing teams know how to best elevate each other skills
  * I speculate this is from strong social connections and established psychological saftey
* "Gelling factor": How people learn to work with each other
  * Takes time to adjust / create
* Systems are usually self healing
  * A database slows down
  * People take more time on tasks
* **You only get value when something is finished**
* Write discoverable documentation
* Do not write code that enforces policies to keep code flexible for as long as possible in the future
* Avoid gatekeeping as much as possible as to not inhibit innovation
* **Organizational debt exists from old/legacy processes that impede value flow**
* Succession planning is important for long term success of an organization
  * Create list of high to low risk areas that you do and work one-by-one to elimintate
* Leaders act like glue when gaps form in the system
  * I assume this is more based on credibility in horizontal or formal authority in heriartical structures
* Measurements
  * Label every flow (rate)
  * Label every stock (quantity)
* **Model systems from code reviews to team structures to value streams to find out where the blottle necks / blockers / flow limiters are**
* Stratagies: Grounded documents that outline the actions and tradeoffs to address a specific challange
* Visions: Aspirational documents taht enable people who do not work closey together to make decisions that fit together
* Recommended reading: [Nudge](https://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/014311526X); [Good Stratagies and Bad Stratagies](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Strategy-audiobook/dp/B07R6XQ8YP)
* How to write stratagies:
  1. Problem statement
  2. Identify policies
  3. Guiding actions (focus on X at the dismay of Y)
* Visions
  * Allow distributed coordination with little overhead communication costs
  * Reiterate constantly to reinforce and cut through communcation noise
  * Include value proposition/impact on end users
  * Use present tense
  * Write simply: no buzz words
* **Goals**
  * Investement goals: where do you want to be?
    * Limit to 3
  * Baseline goals: where are we currently so that we do not regress?
* **Migrations are often the only meannigful solutions to technical debt.**
  1. Derisk migration
  2. Enable/afford through ...
      * Good documentation
      * Automate as much as possible
      * Always revertable to working state
  3. Finish the migration with 100% adoption
      * Stop the bleeding by enforcing new standard/policy for new work
      * Prioritize finishing the migration
* **Making technical migrations and reorganizing people cheap is the key to long term organizational growth and market fit**
* Put teams as close together as possible to facilitate shared context
  * Most poor relationships are information gaps that can be fixed with closer proximity
* **Do not optimize for the individual - individuals are single points of failure**
* **People do not process well in large groups - break into smaller groups (e.g. one-on-ones) for more meaningful feedback**
* Career narratives: How you can facilitate career growth in others
  * Discover the intersection of business value and personal passion
* **Model, document, and share to lead without authoirty**
  1. Build metrics to measure change
  2. Do personally / at the team level (experiment)
  3. Document how another team could adopt this process
  4. Share to the wider organization
* Decentralized decision making but create centralized advisory groups for consistancy across the organization (e.g. Node vs Python)
  * Watch out for status hunters, bottlenecks, etc. that may artifically limit flow
* When giving a presentation start with the conclusion
  * Frame the topic with relavant and short historical context
  * Derive actions from principles and know your data for adhoc questions
  * Preparing (understanding) > practice (parroting)
  * Steps
      1. Tie topic to business value (1-2 sentences)
      2. Establish historical narrative (2-4)
      3. Explicit ask (1-2)
      4. Data driven diagnosis
      5. Decision making principles
      6. What next and when it will be done
      7. Return to explicit ask
* In time mangement, always prioritize long term success
* **Focus on building a learning community with peers**
  * Be a facilitator not lecturer
  * Short presentations with long discussions
  * Break out groups vs large groups
* Exceptions to policies are bias and inefficient: keep consistent
* Good policies are opinionated and constrain behavior
* Norms inform behavior, policies enforce it
* Consistently enforce policy constraints
* Use requested policy exceptions to inform and rethink policy
* Commit to reevaluating policy at regular inervals (e.g. X weeks)
* Do the hard thing now, do not postpone it
* Build social networks to get work done effectively
* Authority is a weak way to work that limits innovation and is usually far from the information
* Prioritize your time to work on impactful things and not things that just show up on your calendar
* Professional growth comes from scope of work being done in the orgnization, not the number of people reporting to you
  * Look for gaps in the curent org to fill
* When work comes your way, do one of the following:
  1. Close out and quickly and permanently as possible
  2. Solve: Design a solution so that you do not have to handle it again within 6 months (e.g. policies)
  3. Delegate to somebody else
* **Culture only changes through persistent and consistent effort**
* Inclusive Cultures: everybody has access to opportunity and membership
* Make policies explicit
  * You have $X per year in education
* Membership is the precursor to belonging
  * Facilitate conversations across people to nurture relationships
* Let people apply for opportunities to lead secretly (i.e. non-public facing) and give 3 days time to get new people in
* Attach a mentor to every new leader
* Foster a culture that focuses on the growth of others, not yourself
  1. Know about peers work
  2. Evolve perception of character into a living person
  3. Referee defection to ensure good faith between everybody
  4. Avoid 0-sum games
  5. Make principle of peer-first explicit
* Only change 1 thing per projcet (e.g. database A with framework A to database B with framework A) to effectively observe changes on outcomes
* Working harder when already working hard eliminates and burns out people
* Hero programming are a sign of bad culture and policy to focus on the very short term
  * Let these systems fail fast to then "reset" and change fast
  * Fail -> Lean -> Try again
* Focus on career transitions/events (e.g. your boss leaving) and what skills were required to work in that new environment
  * Transitions let you build new skills
  * Stability lets you master skills
  * Growth only comes from change
* Mentor-mentee relationshp are important from project leads to canidate interviews
* Hire beyond personal networks to avoid hegemony by using cold sourcing
* Build networks through cold coffees
* Enthusiasm != passion
* Make career ladders concrete like policies
  * Start with 3 rungs, iterate as needed
  * Compare people to the ladder, not each other for promotions
* As an effective leader you need to explain simply to leadership how your goals (e.g. cold coffee, group chats, etc.) drive business or culture outcomes
* Crisis designations to retain "important" people should be used rarely and all implications to the ladder sould be considered
* Specialists are single points of failure
* Ensure there is career growth for every role as best as possible in your organization to retain people
* **You cannot improve a flow without being able to observe and measure it**
* Avoid design by committee in favor of small working groups to iterate faster
  * Committee results in bike shedding
* Management is about staying out of the details but keeping the work aligned to business value
* Keep roadmap and backlog small to remain flexible (agile)
  * Roadmap is a view for stakeholders
  * Backlog is a view for team
* Read: [No Silver Bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet)
* Teams need clear goals they can visually look at to better focus/align on those outcomes as a team
* Add constraints to the system to discover optimizations
* **Accidental vs essential complexity**
  * Remove accidental complexity from bad code, organization, etc. design so that we can focus on essential complexity in our business domain/market
* Source code rejuvination: migrate old code to current standards using automated scripts
