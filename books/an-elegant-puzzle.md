# An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Software Engineering Management

Manager should support at most 6 - 8 engineers

Keep innovation and technical debt (e.g.s bugs) as 1 team
  * Avoid 2 teired system by keeping innovationg and learning int he same team

High performing teams know how to best elevate each other skills
  * I speculate this is from strong social connections and established psychological saftey

"Gelling factor": How people learn to work with each other
  * Takes time to adjust / create

Systemsa re usually self healing
  * A database slows down
  * People take more time on tasks

You only get value when something is finished

Write discvoerable documentation

Do not write code that enforces policies to keep code flexible for as longa s possible in the future

Avoid gatekeeping as much as possible

Organizational debt exists from old/legacy processes that implede value flow

Succession planning is important for long term success of an organization
  * Create list of high to low risk areas that you do and work one-by-one to elimintate

Leaders act like glue when gaps form in the system
  * I assume this is more based on credibility in horizontal or formal authority in heriartical structures

Measurements
  * Label every flow (rate)
  * Label every stock (quantity)

Model systems from code reviews to team structures to valute streams to find out where the blottle necks / blockers / flow limiters are

Stratagies: Grounded documents that outline the actions and tradeoffs to address a specific challange.

Visions: Aspirational documents taht enable people who do not work closey together to make decisiosn that fit together
