### Introduction

* Laws of Combat: Cover & Move, Simple, Prioritize & Execute, Decentralize Command

* Study to memorize the basics to make reactions quick
* Establish procedures with clear guidelines so unexpected situations have guardrailes
* Strategize to make decision making quick and decentralized in uncertain situations

* "For all the definitions, descritions, and characterizations of leaders, there aer only two that matter: effective and ineffective." - p 8
* "By leadership, we do not mean just the senior commanders at hte top, but the crucial leaders at every level of the team" - p 11
* "How a junior leader was brought up depends entirely on the strength experience, and patient guidance of a mentor." - p 11
* "They must literally risk life and limb to acomplish the mission. For this reason, they must believe in the cause for which they are fighting. THey must believe in the plan they are asked to execute , and more important, they must believe in and trust he leader they are asked to follow." - p 12
* "Combat leadership requires getting a diverse team of people in various groups to execute hightly complex missions in order to achieve strategic goals." p 12
* "Simple, but not easy" - p 13
* "Leaders must own everything in their world. There is no one else to blame." - p 14

* **Key takeaways**
  * Practice, practice, practice - route memorization of the basics makes decisions faster. In software, this may manifest itself in coding stylings: standardize and commit.
  * Share the big picture - enable autonomous decison making in unfamiliar environments by making the goals / mission clear.
  * Leaders are either effective or ineffective.

### Part 1

#### Extreme Ownership (chapter)

* Chapter describes blue-on-blue friendly fire incident and the different events / gaps / mishaps / lack of communications / ... which lead to the friendly fire situtation.
* "I was responsible for everything ... I had to take complete ownership of what went wrong, That is what a leader does - evern if it means getting fired." - p 26
* "We analyzed what had happened and implemented hte lessons learned. We revised our standard operating procedures and planning methodology to better mitigate risk." - p 29
* "[T]he leader is truely and uiltimately responsible for *everything*." - p 29
* "The leader must own everything in his or her world. There is no one else to blame." - p 30
* "The leader bears full responsibility for explaining the strategic mission, developing the tactics, and securing the training and resources to enable the team to properly and successfully execute." - p 30
* "When a leader sets such an example and expects this form junior leaders within the team, they mind-set develops into the team's culture at every level." - p 31

* **Key takeaways**
  * Leaders are responsible for everything and everyone under their command - no excuses.
  * Lead by example, teach through example - get the entire team from top-to-bottom to think and act in the same ways (REF: Turn This Ship Around)

#### No bad teams, only bad leaders

* "SEAL officers were expected to perform like everyone else, but more important, they were also expected to lead." - p 46
* "It was a shocking turn turn of events. Boat Crew VI, the same team in the same circumstances only under new leadership, went form the worst boat crew in the class to the best." - p 48
* "... leadership is the single greatest factor in any team's performance." - p 49
* "The leader's attitude sets the tone for the entire team. The leader drives performance - or doesn't. And this applies not just to the most senior leader of an overall team, but to hte junior leaders of teams within the team." - p 49
* "I discovered that it was far more effective to focus their efforts not on the days to come or the far-distant finish line they coulnd't yet see, but instead on a physical goal immediately in front of them - the beach marker, landmark, or road sign a hundred yards ahead. If we could execute with a monumental effort just to reach an immediate goal that everyone could see, we could then continue to the next visually attainable goal and then the next." - p 49
* "In protecting my boat crew, I actually sheltered a couple of perpetual underperformers who dragged the rest of the boat crew down." - p 50
* "When leaders who epitomize Extreme Ownership drive their teams to achieve a higher standards of performance, they must recognize that when it comes to standards, as a leader, *it's not what you preach, it's what you tolerate*." - p 54
* "... if substandard performance is accepted and no one is held accountable - if there are no consequences - that poor performance becomes the new standard." - p 54
* "The best teams anywehre, like the SEAL Teams, are constantly looking to improve, add capability, and push the standards higher." - p 55
* "Each member demanding the highest performance from the others. Repetitive exceptional performance became a habit." - p 59
* "If you aren't winning ... then you aren't making the right decisions." - p 60
  * Possible to be making the right decisions with the information you have, but if bad outcomes perhaps there is information missing / knowledge gaps to fill to widen the decision space (i.e. seek new perspectives to discover new solutions).
* "... a Tortured Genius, in this sense, accepts zero responsibility for mistakes, makes excuses, and blames everyone else for their failings (and those of their team)." - p 60
* "... when it comes to performance standards, *It's not what you preach, it's what you tolerate*." - p 61

* **Key takeaways**
  * Leaders create and reinforce the culture.
  * Make exceptional performance a habit through repetitive route memorization of the basics. This way, standards are known, expected, and enforced so teams can focus on solving other bigger problems. Where there are gaps, leverage extreme ownership to workaround temporarily and if recurring establish new standards.
  * "If you aren't winning ... then you aren't making the right decisions." (p 60), perhaps because the wrong decisions are being made or there is a lack of information making the decision space to narrow. If you don't feel like you are winning, figure out why.
  * A "Tortured Genius" is somebody who does not take extreme ownership (e.g. accepts zero responsibility) and drags teams down.

#### Believe

* Practice, practice, practice to execute effectively - low stakes means high safety to fail and in turn learn.
* "In the SEAL Teams, the bond of our brotherhood is our strongest weapon. If you take that away from us, we lose our most important quality as a team." - p 69
* "But as Task Unit Bruiser's commander, I knew my actions and mind-set carried great weight among my troops. These were my orders, and for me to lead, I had to believe. So I kept my doubts to myself as I asked the simple question: *Why?*" - p 69
* "I knew I had to adjust my perspective, to mentally step back from the immediate fight just outside the wire and think about this question from a strategic level, as if I were one of those generals in Baghdad or back at the Pentagon. Sure, they were far from the front lines, but certainly, they had the same goal we did: to win. That lead to another question: What was winning?" - p 70
* "But they did have to understand why they were doing it so that they could believe in hte mission." - p 73
* "If I didn't believe in it, there was no way I could possibly convinec the SEALs in my task unit to believe it. If I expressed doubts or openly questioned the wisdom of this plan in front of the trooops, their derision toward the mission would increase exponentially. They would never believe in it. As a result, they would never commit to it, and it would fail." - p 74
* "If a leader does not believe, he or she will not take the risks required to overcome the inevitable challenges necessary to win." - p 76
* "Junior leaders must ask questions and also provide feedback up the chain so that senior leaders can fully understand the ramifications of how strategic plans affect execution on the ground." - p 78
* "Belief in the mission ties in with the fourth Law of Combat: Decentralized Command (chatper 8). The leader must explain not just what to do, but *why*." - p 78
* "She talked about maintaining and 'open-door policy'. But in the minds of her sales managers, she was still *The Boss*: experienced, smart, and most important, powerful. That position demanded a high level of reverence - so high, in fact, that for an employee to question her ideas seemed disrespectful." - p 81
* "If you don't understand or believe in the decisions coming down from yuour leadership, it is up to you to ask questions until you understand how and why those decisions are being made. Not knowing the *why* prohibits you from believing in the mission." - p 84
* "So, if you ever get a task or guidance or a mission that you don't believe in, don't just sit back and accept it. Ask questions until you understand *why* so you can believe in what you are doing and you can pass that information down the chain to your team with confidence, so they can get out and execute the mission. That is leadership." - p 85

* **Key takeaways**
  * Practice, practice, practice to fail in safe environments so learnings / insights can be gained and applied in real scenarios.
  * The goal of a leader should be to understand the *why* and to ask questions of other leaders until they understand that *why* clearly. The *why* informs the *how*. So, to act effectively the *why* must be understood.
  * Culture and principles, such as "open-door policies", must be demonstrated through practicies / actions. Saying and doing are different things. And many times folks do not being the saying until they see the doing. This is particularly true for leaders higher up in an organization; the higher the power differential, the more intentional acts must be.

#### Check the ego

* "Discipline in such a situation started with the little things ... with that, the more important things fall into place ..." - p 95
* "Discipline created vigilance and operational readines, which translated to high performance and success on the battlefield." - p 95
* "It was immaterial which units did what or who conducted the most operations. It was about the mission and how we could best accomplish it and win." - p 97
* "But the colonel and his troops simply could not risk working with a group where some members' egos prevented them from ever fully integrating with the 1/506th battalion." - p 99-100
* "Ego clouds and disrupts everyting: the planning process, the ability to take good advice, and the ability to accept constructive criticism." - p 100
* "Implementing Extreme Ownership requires checking your ego and perating with a high degree of humility. Admiting mistakes, taking ownership, and developing a plan to overcome challenges are integral to any successful team." - p 100
* "At a tactical level, on the front lines where the guys in the field execute the mission ... it is critical that the troops graps how what they do connects to the bigger picture." - p 103
* "I'm confident it will. If you approached it as *he* did something wrong, and *he* needs to fix something, and *he* is at fault, it becomes a clash of egos and you will be ad odds. That's human nature. But, if you put your own ego in check, neaning *you* take the blame, that will allow him to actually see the problem without his vision clouded by ego. Then you both can make sure that your team's standard operating procedures - when to communicate, what is and isn't within his decision-making authority - are clearly understood." - p 104

* **Key takeaways**
  * Discipline in the little things it what affords bigger things to fall into place. From a coding perspective, standards around code patterns makes it easier to think about how to solve big buisnes problems instead of fighting the code as well.
  * When folks are bought into a mission and understand the goals, it shouldn't matter who does what to achieve those goals in an ego-less culture.
  * Ego clouds objective judgement.
  * As a leaders with an extreme ownership mindset, you own the culture. If folks are not following standard operating procedures that is a failure on your part and a failure you must address through your leadership. Improve how to communicate the *why* of the mission so teams can make better autonomous decisions - but also when they need to better communicate upwards or seek permissions.

### Part 2

#### Cover and move

* "No options were good options. We had to choose the least bad option." - p 117
* "Our tactic, which we had trained for, practiced, and utilized, was a fundamental one we called 'Cover and Move.'" - p 119
  * Practice, practice, practice the fundementals so they are second nature! Learning during an emergency is a setup for failure
* "We had used Cover and Move within my own immediate OP2 team, but I had forgotten about the greater teama and support availible. We had operated independently, failing to support or help each other." - p 120-121
* "The most important tactical advantage we had was working together as a team, always supporting each other. It was a rude awakening for me. I had become so immersed in the details, decision points, and immediate challenges fo my own team that I had forotten about the other team, what they could do for us and how we might help them." - p 121
* "All elements within the greater team are crucial and must work together to accomplish the mission, mutually supporting one another for that single purpose. Departments and groups within the team must break down silos, depend on each other and understand who depends on them. If they forsake this principle and operate independently or work against each other, the results can be catastrophic to the overall team's performance." - p 122
* "These individuals and teams must instead find a way to work together, communicate with each other, and mutually support one another. The focus must always be on how to best accomplish the mission." - p 122
* "Those Army and Marine Corps units we worked with were not under our control. We had different bosses. But we depended on them and they depended on us. So we formed relationships with them and worked together to accomplish the overall mission of securing Ramadi. That's Cover and Move." - p 125

* **Key takeaways**
  * Practice, practice, practice the fundementals so they are second nature! Learning during an emergency is a setup for failure.
  * It is easy to go heads down and focus on your own work - ignoring how others can support you in your mission or how you can support others in theirs. At the end of the day, everybody in a company has the same mission (i.e. profitability, job security, etc.) so intentionally support one another, intentionally build strong working relationships, and intentionally win together.

#### Simple

* "Combat, like anyting in life, has inherent layers of complexities. Simplifying as much as possible is crucial to success. When plans and orders are too complicated, people may not understand them. And whe things go wrong, and *they inevitably do go wrong*, complexity compounds issues that can spiral out of control into toal disaster." - p 140
* "Plans and orders must be communicated in a manner that is simple, clear, and concise. Everybody that is part of the mission must know and understand his or her role in the mission and what to do in the event of likely contingencies." - p 140
* "... frontline troops [must] ask questions that clarify when they do not understand the mission or key tasks to be performed. Leaders must encourage this communication and take the time to explain so that every member of hte team understands." - p 140
* "It was essential to keep things simple so that everyone on the team understood." - p 142
* "What matters is that *they* understand it - your production team. And not in some theoretical way. They need to understand it to a point that they don't need to be thinking about it to understand it. It needs to be on the top of their minds all the time." - p 144
* "It certainly is possible that they *could*. But they *don't*. People generally take the path of least resistance. It is just in our nature." - p 145
* "While the troops might understand their individual pieces of the plan, they have a hard time following all the intricacies of the grand scheme. Perhaps they can even get away with that a few times if everything goes smoothly, but remember: the enegemy gets a vote." - p 145
* "When something goes wrong - and it eventually does - complex plans add to confusion, which compound into disaster." - p 145
* "If the plan is simple enough, everyone understands it, which means each person can rapidly adjust and modify what he or she is doing." - p 145
* "The most impressive thing about this [sales bonus / incentive] improvement in performance ws that it did not come from a major process change or an advance in technology. Instead, it came through a leadership principle that has been around for ages: Simple." - p 147

* **Key takeaways**
  * Keep the mission simple and know everybody envolved with the mission understands their part and the bigger picture. Complexity or misunderstanding compounds into confusion which create disasters. Keep it simple so folks can think about the nuance of doing and adjust appropriately when something inevitably goes wrong.
  * The people doing the work must ask clarifying questions when they don't understand the misson or key tasks to be performed to achieve that mission. On the other hand, leaders must encourage, grow, and enforce this culture.
  * Impressive productivity gains can be earned through simplification and clear understanding by doers. It is the mission of leaders to make things simple and enforce understanding.

#### Prioritize and execute

* "How could we possibly tackle so many problems at once? Prioritize and Execute." - p 158
* "Once the wheels were in motino and the full resources of the team were engaged in that highest priority effort, I could then determine the next priority, focus on the team's effor there, and then move on to the next priority. I could not allow myself to be overwhelmed. I had to relax, look around, and make a call. That was what Prioritize and Execute was all about." - p 158
* "All the training had imparted the instrinct of Prioritize and Execute on the whole platoon. The entire team would simultaneously assess problems, figure out which one was most important with minimum direction from me, and handle it before moving on to the next priority problem." - p 159
* "On the battlefield, countless problems compound in a snowball effect, every challenge complex in its own right, each demanding attention. But a leader must remain calm and make the best decisions possible. To do this, SEAL combat leaders utilize Prioitize and Execute. We verbalize this principle with this direction: 'Relax, look around, make a call." - p 161
* "If the team has been briefed and understands what actions to take through such likely contingencies, the team can then rapidly execute when those problems arise, even without specific direction from leaders. This is a critical characteristic of any high-performance, winning team in any business or industry." - p 162
* "It is critical, particularly for leaders at the top of the organization, to 'pull themselves off the firing line,' step back, and maintain the strategic picture." - p 162
* "To implement Prioritize and Execute ... :"  - p 162
  1. Evaluate the highest priority problem
  2. Lay out in simple, clear, and concise terms the highest priority effort for your team
  3. Develop and determine a solution, seek input from key leaders and from the team where possible
  4. Direct the execution of that solution, focusing all efforts and resources toward this priority task
  5. Move on t the next priority problem. Repeat.
  6. When priorities shift within the team, pass situational awareness both up and down the chain.
  7. Don't let the focus on one priority cause target fixation. Maintain the ability to see other problems developing and rapidly shift as needed.
* "Prioritize your problems and take care of them one at a time, the highest priority first. Don't try to do everyting at once or you won't be successful." - p 165

* **Key takeaways**
  * Do not tackle every problem at once, evaluate and prioritize the first most important thing. Get the team working on that problem. Once the team has momentum, find the next most important thing. But do not get target fixation. If the situtation changes, hard-pivoting may be better than staying in a bad situtation.

#### Decentralized command

* "On the battlefield, I expected my subordinate leaders to do just that: *lead*." - p 170
* "Pushing the decision making down to the subordinate, front-line leaders within the task unit was critical to our success. This Decentralized Command structure allowed me, as the commander, to manitian focus on the bigger picture: coordinate friendly assets and monitor enemy activity. Were I to get embroiled in the details of a tactical problem, there would be no one else to fill my role and manage the strategic mission." - p 171
* "During the first few days of Task Unit Bruiser's MOUT training, my SEAL leaders tried to control everything and everyone themselves. They tried to direct every maneuver, control every position, and personally attempted attempted to manage each one of their men - up to thirty-five individuals in Task Unit Vruiser. It did not work. ... no person had the cognitive capacity, the physical presence, or the knowledge of everything happening across a complex battlefield to effectively lead in such a manner."  - p 172
* "... Commander's Intend[], and standard operating procedures[:] that was effective Decentralized Command." - p 172
* "Those junior leaders learned that they were expected to make decisions. They couldn't ask, 'What do I do?' Instead, they had to state: 'This is what I am *going to do*." - p 173
  * I intend to ... from REFERENCE: Turn This Ship Around
* "... commander's guideance ... my platoon commanders understanood this guidance as well - perhaps even better than I. Therefore, I did not need to spell it out for each operation; it was embedded in their thoughts." - p 175
* "With my leaders running thei rteams and handling the tactical decisions, it made my job much easier by enabling me to focus on the bigger picture." - p 176
* "The fog of war in a chaotic urban environment grows thick rapidly and could muddle even the most seemingly obvious situtations." - p 179
* "Had I been engulfed in trying to lead and direct Charlie and Delta Platoons' tactical decisions from my distant position, I may very well have missed the other events unfolding. This could have had catastrophic results." - p 183
* "Human beings are generally not capable of managing more than six to ten people, particularly when things go sideways and inevitably contingencies arise. ... Teams must be broken down into manageable elements of four to five operators, with a clearly designated leaders. Those leaders must understand the overall mission, and the ultimate goal of that mission - that Commander's Intent. Junior leaders must be empowered to make decisions on key tasks necessary to accomplish that missoin in the most effective and efficient manner possible." - p 183
* "Every tactical-level team leader must undersatnd *not just what to do but why they are doing it*. If frontline leaders do not understand why, they must ask their boss to clarify the why. This ties in very closely with Believe (chapter 3)." - p 183
* "... junior leaders must fully understand what is within their decision-making authority - the 'left and right limits' of their responsibility. Additionally, they must communicate with senior leaders to recommend decisions outside their authority and pass critical information up the chain so the senior leadership can make informed strategic decisions." - p 184
* "We call this trait 'battlefield aloofness'. This attitude creates a significant disconnect between leadership and the trioops, and such a leader's team will struggle to effectively accomplish their mission." - p 185
* "When that happens, he gets focused on the minutia of what's going on in the immediate room and loses situational awareness of what is happening with the rest of the team and can no longer provide effective command and control. Other times, the officer gets stuck in the back of the train, on cleanup duty. When that happens, he is too far in the rear to know what is happening up front and can't direct his assult force. I advised many officers that the right amount of involvement - the proper position for them - was somewhere in the middle, generally with the bulk of their force ..." - p 185
* "Leaders must be free to move to where they are most needed, which changes throughout the course of an operation." - p 185
* "Without a clear chain of command - people knowing who is in charge of what - you cannot have empowered leadership. And that is critical to the success of any team ..." - p 186
* "... militaries throughout history, are based around building blocks of four-to-six-man teams with a leader. We call them 'fire teams.' That is the ideal number for a leader to lead. Beyond that, any leader can lose control as soon as even the minimal pressure is applied to the team when inevitable challenges arise." - p 188
* "I could only truely lead, manage, and coordinate with about four to six, max." - p 189
* "Proper Decentralized Command requires simple, clear, concise orders that can be understood easily by everyone in that chain of command." - p 189
* "A mission statement tells your troops what you are doing. But they have got to understand the *why* they are doing it. When the subordinate leaders and the frontline troops fully understand the purpose of the mission, how it ties into strategic goals, and what impact it has they can then lead, even in the absence of explicit orders." - p 190
* "Trust is not blindly given. It must be build over time. ... Open conversations build trust. Overcoming stress and challenging environments builds trust. Working through emergencies and seeing how people react builds trust." - p 191

* **Key takeaways**
  * Everybody on the team must understand the *mission* (i.e. what we want to accomplish) and the *why* behind this mission - this is the [Commander's Intent](https://github.com/1Mill/notes/blob/main/presentations/commanders-intent-enables-great-leadership.md) - to enable decentralized command. Understanding the Commander's Intent allows subordinate leaders to adapt the *how* to achive the *mission* in the fog of war. Since the fog of war can be thick, it is also critial for leaders to outline guardrailes for these subordinate leaders to make it clear what decisions they can and cannot make. Similarly, it is critical to build a communicative culture where subordinate leaders pro-actively bubble information up to leaders who also pro-actively bubble information down to stay aligned within the context of the big picture.
  * People build trust by doing things together.
  * A single person can only lead four to six people effectively in chaotic situations - otherwise communication and decision making break down. Build all layers of the organization with this constraint in mind.
  * Junior leaders cannot ask 'What do I do?' in the middle of combat, instead they must state 'This is what I intend to do' communicated up the chain as part of an advise seeking process (not to be confused with permission seeking unless the situation requires it).

### Part 3

#### Plan

* "You could never assume that such hazard weren't waiting for you on a target. You had to assume they were, and you had to plan for them on *every* operation and mitigate the risk of those threats as much as possible. To assume otherwise was a failure of leadership. That was what mission planning was all about: never taking anything for granted, prepairing for likely contingencies, and maximizing the chance of mission success while minimizing the risk to the troops executing the operation." - p 203
* "For any team in any business or industry, it is essential to develop a standardized planning process." - p 203
* "A broad and ambiguous mission results in lack of focus, ineffective execution, and mission creep. To prevent this, the mission must be carefully refined and simplified so that it is explicitly clear and specifically focused to achieve the greater strategic vision for which that mission is a part." - p 204
* "The mission must explain the overall purpose and desire result, or 'end state,' of the operation. The frontline troops tasked with executing the mission must understand the deeper purpose behind the mission." - p 204
* "It is critical to utilize all assets and lean on the expertise of those in the best position to provide the most accurate and up-to-date information." - p 204
* "Leaders must delegate the planning process down the chain as much as possible to key subordinate leaders. Team leaders within the greater team and frontline, tactical-level leaders must have ownership of their tasks within the overall plan and mission." - p 204
* "While the senior leader supervises the entire planning process by team members, he or she must be careful not to get bogged down in the details. By maintaining a perspective above the microterrain of the plan, the senior leader can better ensure compliance with the strategic objecetives. Doing so enables senior leaders to 'stand back and be the tactical fgenius' - to identify weeknesses or holes in the plan that most immersed in the details might have missed. This enables leaders to fill in those gaps before execution." - p 205
* "Leaders must carefully prioritize the information to be presented in a simple, clear, and concise a format as possible so that participants do not expeirence information overload." - p 205
* "If frontline troops are unclear about the plan and yet are too intimidated to ask questions, the team's ability to effectively execute the plan radically decreases. Thsu, leaders must ask questions of their troops, encourage interactions, and ensure their teams understand the plan." - p 205
* "U.S. Navy, John Paul Jones, said: 'Those who will not risk cannot win.'" - p 206
* "What went right? What went wrong? How can we adapt our tactics to make us even more effective and increase our advantage over the enemy?" - p 206

* "A leader's checklist for planning should include the following:" - p 207
  * Analyze the mission - understand the Commander's Intent and restart your own.
  * identify personnel, assets, resources, and time available.
  * Decentralize the planning process
  * Determine a specific course of actoin
  * Empower key leaders
  * Plan for likely contingencies
  * Mitigate risk that can be controlled as much as [reasonably] possible
  * Delegate portions of the plan and brief to key junior leaders
  * Continually check and question the plan against emerging information to ensure it still fits the situtation
  * Breif the plan to all participants and supporting assets
  * Conduct post-operational debrif after execution

* "The OPORD breifing format we were given was developed for a 96-hour planning cycle: it assumed we would have at least 4 days to prepare for a combat mission. ... In actual practice, we had only a few hours to plan for our training exercises, so the long and detailed format invariably left us far too little time. We wasted most of our efforts building slides and neglected important peices of the plan."
* "Here is what I want you to do: forget about all this crazy PowerPoint. I want this plan to be clear to everyone that is actually *in* your platoon. I'm nmot worried about the CO or the master cheif. Brief it to your guys: the troops wo will be executing the mission." - p 213
* "... as leaders, we must not get dragged into the details but instead remain focused on the bigger picture." - p 214
* "With everyone understanding my 'Commander's Intnet' ... the team is able to be more decisive on the front lines. They can suport the mission without having to run evry question up the chain of command. Our ability to plan is enabling us to better execute and win." - p 218

* **Key takeaways**
  * Understand the Commander's Intent (e.g. goal, desired end state) and ask why for further clarity; shape and share your own Commander's Intent to the team and junior leaders. Then, start executing. Question the why behind the team's tactical decisions and ensure those decisions still line up with the desired end-state. Also, pro-actively communicate up these tactical decisions to keep the Commander informed.
  * Make the Commander's Intent as clear and simple as possible so that everybody know how they can help support the mission without having to ask how.
  * After outlining the Commander's Intent, the leader must get out of the way by delegating the details so they can keep the broader strategic mission in mind.

#### Leaderup and down the chain of command

* "This was a stricking realization: I was Charlie Platoon commander, second in seniority only to Jocko in Task Unit Bruiser. And yet, immersed in the details of the tactical operations, I had not fully appriciated or understood how those operations so directly contributed to the strategic mission with spectacular results beyond anyone's wildest dreams." - p 227
* "For a young SEAL shooter with a very limited role in the planning process who was out working on his weapons and gear, conducting maintenance on our vehicles, or building demolition charges for the breacher, he waslked into our missoin breifs wondering: *What are we doing next?* He had no context for why we were doing the operation or how the next tactical mission fit into the bigger picture of stabilizing and securing Ramadi." - p 227
* "... even when a leader thinks his troops understand the bigger picture, they very often have difficulty connecting the dots between the tactical mission they are immersed in with the greater overarching goal." - p 228
* "... it is paramount that senior leaders explain to their junior leaders and troops executing the mission how their role contributes to big picture success." - p 229
* "The CO and his staff weren't bad guys out to make our lives harder and stifle our operations. They were good people trying to do their jobs the best they could and give us what we needed to accomplish our mission. But they weren't on the battlefield with us.
