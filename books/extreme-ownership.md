## Notes

### Introduction

* Laws of Combat: Cover & Move, Simple, Prioritize & Execute, Decentralize Command

* Study to memorize the basics to make reactions quick
* Establish procedures with clear guidelines so unexpected situations have guardrailes
* Strategize to make decision making quick and decentralized in uncertain situations

* "For all the definitions, descritions, and characterizations of leaders, there aer only two that matter: effective and ineffective." - p 8
* "By leadership, we do not mean just the senior commanders at hte top, but the crucial leaders at every level of the team" - p 11
* "How a junior leader was brought up depends entirely on the strength experience, and patient guidance of a mentor." - p 11
* "They must literally risk life and limb to acomplish the mission. For this reason, they must believe in the cause for which they are fighting. THey must believe in the plan they are asked to execute , and more important, they must believe in and trust he leader they are asked to follow." - p 12
* "Combat leadership requires getting a diverse team of people in various groups to execute hightly complex missions in order to achieve strategic goals." p 12
* "Simple, but not easy" - p 13
* "Leaders must own everything in their world. There is no one else to blame." - p 14

* **Key takeaways**
  * Practice, practice, practice - route memorization of the basics makes decisions faster. In software, this may manifest itself in coding stylings: standardize and commit.
  * Share the big picture - enable autonomous decison making in unfamiliar environments by making the goals / mission clear.
  * Leaders are either effective or ineffective.

### Extreme Ownership (chapter)

* Chapter describes blue-on-blue friendly fire incident and the different events / gaps / mishaps / lack of communications / ... which lead to the friendly fire situtation.
* "I was responsible for everything ... I had to take complete ownership of what went wrong, That is what a leader does - evern if it means getting fired." - p 26
* "We analyzed what had happened and implemented hte lessons learned. We revised our standard operating procedures and planning methodology to better mitigate risk." - p 29
* "[T]he leader is truely and uiltimately responsible for *everything*." - p 29
* "The leader must own everything in his or her world. There is no one else to blame." - p 30
* "The leader bears full responsibility for explaining the strategic mission, developing the tactics, and securing the training and resources to enable the team to properly and successfully execute." - p 30
* "When a leader sets such an example and expects this form junior leaders within the team, they mind-set develops into the team's culture at every level." - p 31

* **Key takeaways**
  * Leaders are responsible for everything and everyone under their command - no excuses.
  * Lead by example, teach through example - get the entire team from top-to-bottom to think and act in the same ways (REF: Turn This Ship Around)

### No bad teams, only bad leaders

* "SEAL officers were expected to perform like everyone else, but more important, they were also expected to lead." - p 46
* "It was a shocking turn turn of events. Boat Crew VI, the same team in the same circumstances only under new leadership, went form the worst boat crew in the class to the best." - p 48
* "... leadership is the single greatest factor in any team's performance." - p 49
* "The leader's attitude sets the tone for the entire team. The leader drives performance - or doesn't. And this applies not just to the most senior leader of an overall team, but to hte junior leaders of teams within the team." - p 49
* "I discovered that it was far more effective to focus their efforts not on the days to come or the far-distant finish line they coulnd't yet see, but instead on a physical goal immediately in front of them - the beach marker, landmark, or road sign a hundred yards ahead. If we could execute with a monumental effort just to reach an immediate goal that everyone could see, we could then continue to the next visually attainable goal and then the next." - p 49
* "In protecting my boat crew, I actually sheltered a couple of perpetual underperformers who dragged the rest of the boat crew down." - p 50
* "When leaders who epitomize Extreme Ownership drive their teams to achieve a higher standards of performance, they must recognize that when it comes to standards, as a leader, *it's not what you preach, it's what you tolerate*." - p 54
* "... if substandard performance is accepted and no one is held accountable - if there are no consequences - that poor performance becomes the new standard." - p 54
* "The best teams anywehre, like the SEAL Teams, are constantly looking to improve, add capability, and push the standards higher." - p 55
* "Each member demanding the highest performance from the others. Repetitive exceptional performance became a habit." - p 59
* "If you aren't winning ... then you aren't making the right decisions." - p 60
  * Possible to be making the right decisions with the information you have, but if bad outcomes perhaps there is information missing / knowledge gaps to fill to widen the decision space (i.e. seek new perspectives to discover new solutions).
* "... a Tortured Genius, in this sense, accepts zero responsibility for mistakes, makes excuses, and blames everyone else for their failings (and those of their team)." - p 60
* "... when it comes to performance standards, *It's not what you preach, it's what you tolerate*." - p 61

* **Key takeaways**
  * Leaders create and reinforce the culture.
  * Make exceptional performance a habit through repetitive route memorization of the basics. This way, standards are known, expected, and enforced so teams can focus on solving other bigger problems. Where there are gaps, leverage extreme ownership to workaround temporarily and if recurring establish new standards.
  * "If you aren't winning ... then you aren't making the right decisions." (p 60), perhaps because the wrong decisions are being made or there is a lack of information making the decision space to narrow. If you don't feel like you are winning, figure out why.
  * A "Tortured Genius" is somebody who does not take extreme ownership (e.g. accepts zero responsibility) and drags teams down.
