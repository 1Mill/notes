## Notes

#### Introduction

* Laws of Combat: Cover & Move, Simple, Prioritize & Execute, Decentralize Command

* Study to memorize the basics to make reactions quick
* Establish procedures with clear guidelines so unexpected situations have guardrailes
* Strategize to make decision making quick and decentralized in uncertain situations

* "For all the definitions, descritions, and characterizations of leaders, there aer only two that matter: effective and ineffective." - p 8
* "By leadership, we do not mean just the senior commanders at hte top, but the crucial leaders at every level of the team" - p 11
* "How a junior leader was brought up depends entirely on the strength experience, and patient guidance of a mentor." - p 11
* "They must literally risk life and limb to acomplish the mission. For this reason, they must believe in the cause for which they are fighting. THey must believe in the plan they are asked to execute , and more important, they must believe in and trust he leader they are asked to follow." - p 12
* "Combat leadership requires getting a diverse team of people in various groups to execute hightly complex missions in order to achieve strategic goals." p 12
* "Simple, but not easy" - p 13
* "Leaders must own everything in their world. There is no one else to blame." - p 14

* **Key takeaways**
  * Practice, practice, practice - route memorization of the basics makes decisions faster. In software, this may manifest itself in coding stylings: standardize and commit.
  * Share the big picture - enable autonomous decison making in unfamiliar environments by making the goals / mission clear.
  * Leaders are either effective or ineffective.

### Part 1

#### Extreme Ownership (chapter)

* Chapter describes blue-on-blue friendly fire incident and the different events / gaps / mishaps / lack of communications / ... which lead to the friendly fire situtation.
* "I was responsible for everything ... I had to take complete ownership of what went wrong, That is what a leader does - evern if it means getting fired." - p 26
* "We analyzed what had happened and implemented hte lessons learned. We revised our standard operating procedures and planning methodology to better mitigate risk." - p 29
* "[T]he leader is truely and uiltimately responsible for *everything*." - p 29
* "The leader must own everything in his or her world. There is no one else to blame." - p 30
* "The leader bears full responsibility for explaining the strategic mission, developing the tactics, and securing the training and resources to enable the team to properly and successfully execute." - p 30
* "When a leader sets such an example and expects this form junior leaders within the team, they mind-set develops into the team's culture at every level." - p 31

* **Key takeaways**
  * Leaders are responsible for everything and everyone under their command - no excuses.
  * Lead by example, teach through example - get the entire team from top-to-bottom to think and act in the same ways (REF: Turn This Ship Around)

#### No bad teams, only bad leaders

* "SEAL officers were expected to perform like everyone else, but more important, they were also expected to lead." - p 46
* "It was a shocking turn turn of events. Boat Crew VI, the same team in the same circumstances only under new leadership, went form the worst boat crew in the class to the best." - p 48
* "... leadership is the single greatest factor in any team's performance." - p 49
* "The leader's attitude sets the tone for the entire team. The leader drives performance - or doesn't. And this applies not just to the most senior leader of an overall team, but to hte junior leaders of teams within the team." - p 49
* "I discovered that it was far more effective to focus their efforts not on the days to come or the far-distant finish line they coulnd't yet see, but instead on a physical goal immediately in front of them - the beach marker, landmark, or road sign a hundred yards ahead. If we could execute with a monumental effort just to reach an immediate goal that everyone could see, we could then continue to the next visually attainable goal and then the next." - p 49
* "In protecting my boat crew, I actually sheltered a couple of perpetual underperformers who dragged the rest of the boat crew down." - p 50
* "When leaders who epitomize Extreme Ownership drive their teams to achieve a higher standards of performance, they must recognize that when it comes to standards, as a leader, *it's not what you preach, it's what you tolerate*." - p 54
* "... if substandard performance is accepted and no one is held accountable - if there are no consequences - that poor performance becomes the new standard." - p 54
* "The best teams anywehre, like the SEAL Teams, are constantly looking to improve, add capability, and push the standards higher." - p 55
* "Each member demanding the highest performance from the others. Repetitive exceptional performance became a habit." - p 59
* "If you aren't winning ... then you aren't making the right decisions." - p 60
  * Possible to be making the right decisions with the information you have, but if bad outcomes perhaps there is information missing / knowledge gaps to fill to widen the decision space (i.e. seek new perspectives to discover new solutions).
* "... a Tortured Genius, in this sense, accepts zero responsibility for mistakes, makes excuses, and blames everyone else for their failings (and those of their team)." - p 60
* "... when it comes to performance standards, *It's not what you preach, it's what you tolerate*." - p 61

* **Key takeaways**
  * Leaders create and reinforce the culture.
  * Make exceptional performance a habit through repetitive route memorization of the basics. This way, standards are known, expected, and enforced so teams can focus on solving other bigger problems. Where there are gaps, leverage extreme ownership to workaround temporarily and if recurring establish new standards.
  * "If you aren't winning ... then you aren't making the right decisions." (p 60), perhaps because the wrong decisions are being made or there is a lack of information making the decision space to narrow. If you don't feel like you are winning, figure out why.
  * A "Tortured Genius" is somebody who does not take extreme ownership (e.g. accepts zero responsibility) and drags teams down.

#### Believe

* Practice, practice, practice to execute effectively - low stakes means high safety to fail and in turn learn.
* "In the SEAL Teams, the bond of our brotherhood is our strongest weapon. If you take that away from us, we lose our most important quality as a team." - p 69
* "But as Task Unit Bruiser's commander, I knew my actions and mind-set carried great weight among my troops. These were my orders, and for me to lead, I had to believe. So I kept my doubts to myself as I asked the simple question: *Why?*" - p 69
* "I knew I had to adjust my perspective, to mentally step back from the immediate fight just outside the wire and think about this question from a strategic level, as if I were one of those generals in Baghdad or back at the Pentagon. Sure, they were far from the front lines, but certainly, they had the same goal we did: to win. That lead to another question: What was winning?" - p 70
* "But they did have to understand why they were doing it so that they could believe in hte mission." - p 73
* "If I didn't believe in it, there was no way I could possibly convinec the SEALs in my task unit to believe it. If I expressed doubts or openly questioned the wisdom of this plan in front of the trooops, their derision toward the mission would increase exponentially. They would never believe in it. As a result, they would never commit to it, and it would fail." - p 74
* "If a leader does not believe, he or she will not take the risks required to overcome the inevitable challenges necessary to win." - p 76
* "Junior leaders must ask questions and also provide feedback up the chain so that senior leaders can fully understand the ramifications of how strategic plans affect execution on the ground." - p 78
* "Belief in the mission ties in with the fourth Law of Combat: Decentralized Command (chatper 8). The leader must explain not just what to do, but *why*." - p 78
* "She talked about maintaining and 'open-door policy'. But in the minds of her sales managers, she was still *The Boss*: experienced, smart, and most important, powerful. That position demanded a high level of reverence - so high, in fact, that for an employee to question her ideas seemed disrespectful." - p 81
* "If you don't understand or believe in the decisions coming down from yuour leadership, it is up to you to ask questions until you understand how and why those decisions are being made. Not knowing the *why* prohibits you from believing in the mission." - p 84
* "So, if you ever get a task or guidance or a mission that you don't believe in, don't just sit back and accept it. Ask questions until you understand *why* so you can believe in what you are doing and you can pass that information down the chain to your team with confidence, so they can get out and execute the mission. That is leadership." - p 85

* **Key takeaways**
  * Practice, practice, practice to fail in safe environments so learnings / insights can be gained and applied in real scenarios.
  * The goal of a leader should be to understand the *why* and to ask questions of other leaders until they understand that *why* clearly. The *why* informs the *how*. So, to act effectively the *why* must be understood.
  * Culture and principles, such as "open-door policies", must be demonstrated through practicies / actions. Saying and doing are different things. And many times folks do not being the saying until they see the doing. This is particularly true for leaders higher up in an organization; the higher the power differential, the more intentional acts must be.

#### Check the ego

* "Discipline in such a situation started with the little things ... with that, the more important things fall into place ..." - p 95
* "Discipline created vigilance and operational readines, which translated to high performance and success on the battlefield." - p 95
* "It was immaterial which units did what or who conducted the most operations. It was about the mission and how we could best accomplish it and win." - p 97
* "But the colonel and his troops simply could not risk working with a group where some members' egos prevented them from ever fully integrating with the 1/506th battalion." - p 99-100
* "Ego clouds and disrupts everyting: the planning process, the ability to take good advice, and the ability to accept constructive criticism." - p 100
* "Implementing Extreme Ownership requires checking your ego and perating with a high degree of humility. Admiting mistakes, taking ownership, and developing a plan to overcome challenges are integral to any successful team." - p 100
* "At a tactical level, on the front lines where the guys in the field execute the mission ... it is critical that the troops graps how what they do connects to the bigger picture." - p 103
* "I'm confident it will. If you approached it as *he* did something wrong, and *he* needs to fix something, and *he* is at fault, it becomes a clash of egos and you will be ad odds. That's human nature. But, if you put your own ego in check, neaning *you* take the blame, that will allow him to actually see the problem without his vision clouded by ego. Then you both can make sure that your team's standard operating procedures - when to communicate, what is and isn't within his decision-making authority - are clearly understood." - p 104

* **Key takeaways**
  * Discipline in the little things it what affords bigger things to fall into place. From a coding perspective, standards around code patterns makes it easier to think about how to solve big buisnes problems instead of fighting the code as well.
  * When folks are bought into a mission and understand the goals, it shouldn't matter who does what to achieve those goals in an ego-less culture.
  * Ego clouds objective judgement.
  * As a leaders with an extreme ownership mindset, you own the culture. If folks are not following standard operating procedures that is a failure on your part and a failure you must address through your leadership. Improve how to communicate the *why* of the mission so teams can make better autonomous decisions - but also when they need to better communicate upwards or seek permissions.
