## Key Takeaways

* There are three types of cultures: pathological, bureaucratic, and generative. Pathological is more individually, politically, and personality based whereas generative is more a collective, mission driven approach. Bureaucratic cultures exists in the middle where rules are imposed to balance the competing interests of the two extremes.

* There are success stories of all 3 cultures, but generative cultures appear to be the most associated with innovation because of their focus on building a community of trust, conscious inquiry, and good judgement which encourages the free flow of information.

* Culture starts with leaders and permeates its way throughout the entire organization. Since many organizations have many layers of leaders, sub-cultures can form around specific people, teams, and departments which impact how information flows. Usually, this inhibits how information flows between different people, teams, and departments unless the organizatino has a more generative culture.

## Notes

* "From case studies and some systematic research it appears that information culture is indeed associated with error reporting and with performance, including safety. Yet this relationship between culture and safety requires more exploration before the connection can be considered definitive."
* "A culture is defined as the organisationâ€™s pattern of response to the problems and opportunities it encounters"
* Culture emerges from the predisposition of org leaders around what a given leader values through actions.
* Culture is the set of processes which shape how an org responds to challanges and opportunities.
* Culture is to an organization as personality is to a person.
* "... culture involved the pattern of though, emotion, and action."
  * These can be explicit or implicit.
* What is the difference between culture and climate?

### THE THREE CULTURES MODEL

* There are three types of cultures:
  * Pathological - power orientated
  * Bureaucratic - rules orientated
  * Generative - performance orientated

* "The most critical issue for organisational safety is the flow of information."
* "... [information flow] is hoarded for political reasons or it languishes due to bureaucratic barriers."
* Leaders communicate what they feel is important through historical reward and punishment (i.e. conditioning) which then impacts their leadership style.
  * Feels very much like survivorship bias which leads to Peter's Principle for people who don't learn the right lessons for the right contexts.
* Information flow is characteristized by its ability to travel from thing A to thing B along with its relevance, timeliness, and appropriateness to thing B.
  * "thing" can be anything including a person or a system
* Generative cultures (i.e. mission driven cultures) emphasize "who needs the information now?" versus pathological cultures view inforamtion as political power.
* "Patterns in information handling thus reflect the climate. If leaders emphasize that information is to help accomplish the mission, that use will predominate. If leaders emphasize that information must advance departmental goals, then that behaviour will predominate. If leaders show through their behaviour that information is only important as it advances or impedes their personal interests, then that use will predominate."
  * Culture flows from how leaders use information and to what ends.

* Good information flow is usually attributed to problem solving and innovation
* Information flow shapes three key variables:
  * Alignment
  * Awareness
  * Empowerment
* To encourage information flow, do not create walled gardens that people work in. Give teams a clear picture of the environment they are working in and why the environment is that way.
* "The ability to think is often coextensive with the ability to act"
  * People will often only put effort into things they can change / have an impact on
* Culture that tend to inhibit information flow sees decreased creativity with increased conflict.
  * Likely because different people with differents sets of information are working and locally optimizing for different individual goals instead of shared goals.
* Psychological saftey is not the same thing as information flow - certain information may flow very well but that does not mean all types of information will flow well.
  * For example, people may readily share good news, but hesistate, hide, or sugercoat bad news.
* There exist success stories for all three types of culture - generative just seems to be the most reusable across different contexts.

### CASE STUDY EVIDENCE

* Case studies
  * USS Benfold
  * 3M
  * Southwest Airlines
  * Chaparral Steel
  * China Lake / Sidewinder missles
    * "community of good judgement"
    * Internal system to fund innovative ideas so innovation and learnings are kept in house
    * Give people flexibility to move around with reasonable constraints for security credentails and relevant knowledge areas to easily collaborate with others in a dynamic fashion
* "... better organisation culture leads to better processing."
* "... potential indicators of latent pathogens"
  1. Supression - harming or stopping the person from sharing the information
  2. Encapsulation - isolating the person so the information is not sharable
  3. Public relations - shaping the message in a way to minimize impact
  4. Local fix - respond to immediate case, but ignore other possible cases elsewhere
  5. Global fix - respond to the problem everwhere it exists
  6. Inquiry - try to identify root cause
* Sometimes local fixes (i.e. workarounds) prevent global fixes from taking place because others are not aware or are also just using their own local fixes.
* Preferred pathogens per culture:
  * Pathological: Supression
  * Bureaucratic: Encapsulation to Global fix
  * Generative: Inquiry

### A STRIKING CONFIRMATION

* "...information flow is higher in a generative situation, where managers see themselves as coaches rather than commanders."
* Encouraging a free and open environment had 10x more visible information flow around error reporting
  * Many unnoticed errors likely got local fixes and went unreported hence the emphasison "visible"


### ORIGINS AND DYNAMICS

* "The successful surgical teams seem to adopt a culture of conscious inquiry, with selective recruitment, open discussion, pre-operation briefings, and a levelling of status differences."
* "...bureaucracy is often a compromise between competing interests."
  * The default culture which sits between the individual personality and the collective mission driven extremes.
* Culture is usually a side effect of what leadership wants intentionally or unintentionally.
* To effect cultural change, you must be intentional.

### DISCUSSION

* Sometimes it is easy for isolated parts of a org to change, like the culture of a single team, but this does not mean their success always permeates out to the larger org despite their apparent success.
  * Sometimes change agents may be targeted for political reasons.
* The larger a culture is, the longer it takes for it to change.
* Every sub-culture works within a broader culture - nothing is every in true isolation - and sometimes these cultures (or the people inside them) can clash.

### CONCLUSION

* Culture represents the habits and actions reinforced through classical and opereant conditioning between management to the workforce. This conditioning effects what information gets shared when, where, how, and by whom.
* Information is the glue that keeps teams together and focused on the same outcomes.
