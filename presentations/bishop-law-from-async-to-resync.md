## Notes

### Presentation

* Bishop's Law: work doen async requires a resync; and the more work done async, the more complex the resync.

* Solar arrays have two common configurations: in parallel and in series.
* Electricity follows the path of least resistence which may damange components unless precaution is taken (e.g. fuses)
* The diameter of the cable also impacts throughout / wattage
  * Big cable, but low current causes energey to disipate within the wire
  * Small cable, but high current causes energey to destroy the wire
  * Fuses need to be around 80% of expected amps to account for overhead

* In series, you daisey chain panels together so only one positive and one negative go to the inverter from the first and last solar pannel.

* Devs working solo / in parellel are sking to solar panels setup in parell: lots of systems to make integration happen.
* Managers become focused on story points (i.e. cable size) so that they don't blow a fuze (e.g. the team doesn't burn out; the team doesn't lose energy)

* Devs in series
  * Handoffs are from developer to developer
  * Nobody really works like this (haha)
* More hands on keyboards feels like more work is being done; but really more work is being started but the same amount of work is being done.
  * Integrations
  * Context switching
  * Hand offs
  * Miscommunication
  * Rebase issues

* Series-Parallel
  * Have sets of series which aggrigate into a single parallel
  * Akin to pair programming - much less overhead

* Bidirectional AC
  * Inverted included in solar panel array
  * Just plug-and-play
  * Akin to mob programming
