## Key Takeaways

* Roadmaps encourage a feature factory menality of just outputting features: not improving outcomes. To try and beat the roadmap mentality, (1) add measurable outcomes to each roadmap item, (2) mention that outcome every time you talk about the roadmap, (3) deliver the roadmap item, (4) continuously report the impact of that delivery on the outcome going forward, (5) repeat for each next roadmap item. Next, with a list of important outcomes, figure out which ones are important to try and improve further.

* Discovery is cheap, deivery is expensive. Try to find and mitigate any known risks through discovery before shifting to a delivery mindset. This means doing UX and feasibility research using wireframes and prototypes. Though, only show high fideility prototypes to executives. Also, this means including engineers early in the discovery process because there is no point wasting time on things that cann't be built by the team. Discovery should be focused on figuring out value, usability, feasibility, and viability whereas delivery should focus on scalability, reliability, performance, and maintinability.

* Engineers are the most overlooked source of innovation. They interact with the enabling technology every day and are humans who are capable of emphasize with customers. So, engineers can often think of new ways to leverage technology befoer anybody else in the org. This also means not to keep engineers in a dark box. Be transparent about the business, economic conditions, and goals to build alignment to produce better, focused solutions.

* All roles solve for or provide context around some set of constraints. For example, designs solve for expeirence within the constraints of UX; engineers solve for implementation within the constraints of technology; product solves for viability withint he constraints of the business; lawyers solve for compliance within the constraints of the law. No single person is a unicorn, so we need cross-constraint (i.e. cross-discipline) collaboration throughout the whole cycle (discovery and delivery) to meaningful deliver customer value to drive business outcomes.

* Think in bets and make impacts measureable. Google reportedly tests out 10 different ideas until 1 meaningfully changes an outcome. This is why making learning cheap is so important because the faster your cycle the faster you can meaningfully produce customer value.

* Technical debt has killed companies. So, it is critical to keep it to a healthy amount. When technical debt is negatively impacting delivery, it means the amount of technical debt is unhealthy. Work arounds only add more technical debt so the only real solution is to pay down the debt. For this reasons, it is best that discovery output work slower than delivery can output work. This way, engineers are always ready to work on the next most important thing when it is ready with this lag time to focus on paying technical debt.

* To migrate from more waterfall-like workflows:
  1. Add measurable metrics that relate to desirable outcomes to all roadmap items. Speak about those roadmap items always within the context how you hope this bet will impact this outcome in this measurable way. Restate this hypothesis every time you talk about htis roadmap item.
  2. When taking on new work from the roadmap, challange assumptions as early and as often as possible. This means using discovery to brainstorm innovative ideas, find risks, and then mitigate or accept those risks before moving into deivery. Include relevant domain experts from design, engineering, data, product, etc. in the conversation using "believability weighted decision making" to make well informed decisions.
  3. Give engineers the autonomy to deliver.
  4. Measure the impact of deliverables on KPIs.
  5. Repeatedly report the impact (or non-impact) of roadmap item on the desired outcome. Data is a great equalizer to prove or disprove bets.
  6. Repeat 1 - 5 for the next roadmap item, but contionusely report on outcomes from previous roadmap items. This slowly reframes roadmap conversations  from the roadmap items to about desired outcomes.

## Notes

* What is the best way to split up our product team? It is a very complex question to answer.

* Outline
  1. People
  2. What we are going to work on
  3. Process
  4. Culture

### People topics

* What does a PM do?
* What are good characteristics of PM?
* Book: Principles, Ray Dalio
  * Runs extreme culture experiments
  * Belivability weighted decisions
    * Not a democracy, your competency in a domain weights your vote
    * You have to grow social / belivability capital by demonstrating your capability or domain knowledge.

* You can work all the time but never get any works done - this is common with being in lots of meetings
  * Need at least 4 hours a day doing real work

* Can't find enough colocated people
  * Being in the same room positively changes the amount of innovation happening rather than remote.
* Product Trio - Engineer, Designer, Product Manager can still work well.
* Contractors is a mercinary - not a missionary.

* Want diversity to get more perspectives to build better solutions inside product teams.
* You need to go and actively work to for diversity.
* Start early so it is easier to maintain as your company grows.


### Process topics

* Dual Track: objective -> discovery -> delivery
* Dual Track is not waterfall, it is all about doing and learning cycles.
* Waterfall only cares about output - not business results.
  * All the risk is at the end - who knows if it meets customers needs.
  * Waterfall can be a two week sprint.
* Discovery, figure out risks up front.
* Product trio figures out delivery just like discovery.
* Looking for results - not outputs
* Iterations mean delivering something useful that is working - not a peice of something that doesn't work.
* Discovery uses prototypes to learn quickly.
  * Value
  * Usability
  * Feasibility
  * Viability
* Delivery uses outpute to improve customer outcomes
  * Scalability
  * Reliability
  * Performance
  * Maintainability
* Engineers should be able to delivery however they see fit

* "If you are only using your engineers to code, you are losing half their value"
* Engineers should be building 90% of the time, but discovery at least part of the time on a weekly basis.
* Don't shelter engineeres / put them in walled garden - let them feel the customer's pain directly by interacting with customers.

* To experiment in a regulated environment:
  * Use opt-in
  * Use invite only
* Lower expectations about sample sizes

* Product roadmaps should be taken with a grain of salt if not almost entirely worthless.
  * Google says 1 in 10 bets work, so what is the point in trying to predict the future to granularly?
* Roadmaps feel like they help align departments and ensure departments / teams are focused on the highest priority stuff - not the highest value stuff.
* Outcome based roadmaps (or transition based roadmaps) are an alternative
  * What is the business result from work item X to define KPIs.
  * Everytime you talk about the roadmap, talk about that KPI.
  * When the item is delivered, report on that KPI to communicate if bet worked our not and most importantly, the next bet you are going to take to improve it further.

* Every aspect of a buisness can impact design (e.g. load times, legal, etc.) - requirements ceom from everywhere.
* Product Owners solve for constraints; engineers solve for implementation; designers solve for experience.
  * All roles solve for some sort of set of constraints

* Tech debt has always been a thing that has killed companies.
* A reasonable amount of tech debt is okay.
* Tech debt is unreasonable when it impacts your time to market.
* It is the CTO's job to ensure the code, architecture, etc. can meet the needs of the buisness.
  * The CTO will be fired from not delivering because of tech debt - not the CPO. So stay on top of it.
* Growing backlogs are usually a sign of tech debt.

* OKRs
  * Really change culture
  * Surfaces hidden issues and conflicts
* OKRs should be results - not just a duplicate copy of the roadmap
* To do OKRs well, you have to have high competancy empowered teams.


### Culture topics

* As companies grow, they become more risk-averse.
* Startups have nothing to loose.
* Product mangers must understand all elements of the business - not just the backlog - must understand all constraints the business is working with.

* Get engineers to interact with customers in pain.
* "No customer asked for Amazon Prime"
* Customers are always unhappy - they always want more.
* Share everything with engineers - the economics, the constraints so they have as much context as possible.
* When engineers see somebody with a problem, then often want to solve that problem with technology.
* Engineers are constistenly the best source of innovation.
  * Engineers are the best at seeing what is just now possible before most others.
  * Engineers understand the technology and can empathize with people - they aren't just robots writing code.

* Pick which battles you choose to fight when leaders dictact what you should do.
* C-Suite cann't get past wireframes - only show high fideilty prototypes.
* Data is the big equalizer - be able to run experiments cheaply and quickly.

* Product culture is a subset of company culture and not every aspect of the company experiences the same culture.
* Culture is stuck in middle management and so it takes a while to change. But it must start from the top.


### Q&A

* Platform management is much more difficult than product management because the technical teams you support are your customers which makes business metrics kind of difficult.

* Google will try 10 different ideas before 1 idea will solve the root problem. This makes roadmaps pretty pointless. Instead, it is focusing on running X experiments a week to try and solve some high priority problem.

* Product teams should be focused on "increasing X", not chasing features on a roadmap.
* Make impact of bets quantifiable through metrics which can be qualitative or quantitative.
* Only do deep discovery on big risk items - "Would they buy it? Would they use it?"
* Reference: Balsamic tool for doing in-house discovery / iterations - then do value / usability test with customers.

* In a startup, one of the cofounders should be the main product person for a while because they have all the detailed customer knowledge and ramping up others takes time.

* Product manager should not play the role of designers unless they have a background / experencing in UX.
* Product managers sometimes like to leverage their old experience to tell the team how to do this new thing. Teams must learn how to work - not be told how to work to stay motivated. Especially if the information being shared is old / outdated.

* "Stubburn on vision, flexible on details" - Jeff Bezos.
* If discovery can't keep up with delivery, engineers should focus on tech debt.
* It is okay for discovery to be slower than delivery but it is not ideal if discovery is faster than delivery because creates backlogs and backlogs are expensive to maintain.

* Opportunity cost is expensive, so try to learn as fast and cheaply as possible through discovery before committing to writing any code.

* Reference: Behind Every Great Product (article)

* To migrate from waterfall:
  1. Tackle risks upfront in discovery
  2. Add measurable outcomes to all roadmap
  3. Try new ideas to try and improve high value business outcomes
  4. Celebrate when outcomes are improved
