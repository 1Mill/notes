# Evaluating performance fairly and accurately

LINK

## Key Takeaways

* Knowing how a person wants to grow in their career is critical to knowing what kind of feedback they are seeking. For people underperforming and/or wanting to move up in the organization feedback is critical.

* When performing evaluations, use both qualitative and quantitive metrics - with a bias towards quantitative to reduce personal biases - with the intent to help people achieve their career goals.

## Notes

* A good performance review includes 4 key components
  1. Be observant and give feedback frequently so that the evaluation should not be a suprise
  2. Make the evaluation accurate by gathering all relevant information
  3. Make your evaluations fair by avoiding common biases
  4. Help people focus on the future

* Bad or inaccurate performance reviews leads people to feel
  * Detached
  * Looking for a new job
  * Discouraged
  * Disconnected
  * Gaps somewhere
* Only 29% of employees strongly agree performance reviews are fair, 26% believe accurate, and only 14% believe it even inspires them to improve - so many thing why do them at all?

* Downsides of performance reviews
  * Significant time investment
  * Create distractions and anxiety
  * Lead people to question qualifications of reviwer, leading to people questioning expertise of managers
* Donwide of NOT doing reviews:
  * Losing touch with people
  * Losing opportunities to inspire
  * Losing opportunities to verify people are on the right track

* To give a fair evaluation, you need
  * What is going on in work and life - context matters if it is a long term isue or a temporary issue
  * What patterns are emerging from the last evluation period? Are things improving? Getting worse? Staying the same?
  * Transparency
  * Clarify what context / role the perosn is filling on the team
  * Factual information about people, not just feelings or perceptions
* If your direct report thinks of their review as an opinion, that is where people start running into issues

* Steps for a fair and accurate performance evaluation
  * Gather and review all relevant performance data
  * Detailed evlauation and explain reasoning
  * Check for bias and reevaluate if nessesary (e.g. recency bias by only looking at activities that happend recently)

* Elements of performance
  * OKRs, KPIs
  * Company values, mission
  * Accomplishments over the entire review period: not just towards the beginning or end
  * Strengths in supporting the team, the mission, etc.
  * Habits in supporting the team, the mission, etc.
  * OTher contributions to the team
* Notes from 1-1 meetings help discover long-term patterns and wins throughout the review period which may have been otherwise overlooked
* Be sure to collect data reliably throughou the review period so you don't have to scramble for it at the last minute
* Things to include for an evaluation
  * Specific results or achievements that support your raiting
  * Strengths or areas for improvement
  * What you are especially pourd of that they have achieved
  * How much you think the person stretched themselves or grew
    * Some people are okay with where they are at and are not looking to grow - so know what the person is looking to do: change, stay, or grow.
  * Steps they think can take to improve in their neext peformance period - ask them to answer first so your answer don't bias them
* Be sure to contextualize the feedback you are giving to people

* Steps for fair and accurate performance evaluations
  * Measurements are more objective; evaluations are more subjective
* Commons biases
  * Affinity bias: people who have similiarities to you that you really value (e.g. same university, region of the world, etc.)
    * Ask "What mental representations am I judging this person against?"
  * Recency Bias: Overvaluing a recent failure more than a big success which happend to be in the past
  * Opportunity Bias: Crediting or faulting someone for factors outside of their control
  * Halo Effect Bias: Letting positive impressions in one area overshadow other negative qualities
  * Horn Effect Bias: Letting negative impressions in one area overshadow other positive qualities

* A key part of making people inspired is making our evaluations as fair and unbiases as posible
