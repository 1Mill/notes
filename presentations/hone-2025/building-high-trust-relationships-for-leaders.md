# Building high trust relationships (for leaders)

LINK

## Key Takeaways

* Trust is something that isn't built in a day. It builds slowly over time by investing in others. Use 1-1s as opportunities to listen and improve the lifes of direct reports at work.

* Words followed through by action build trust.

* Write a User Manel for yourself with how you like to work, what things you value, and more as a blueprint for others to learn how to work effectively with you.

## Notes

* People have struggled building trust and relationships remotely
* Presenter's philosophy
  * Activisim towards building a more equitable soceity
  * Talen is distributed globally - not only locally for specific groups of people
* Stepping slightly outside of your comfort zone is what creates the opportunity and room for growth.

* How to build strong relationships? What do you do?
  * Active listening
  * Prompt response time
  * Must invest 100 hours of time before "friendship" feel like it has formed as said by "friendship researcher"
  * Being on time
  * Following through
  * Acknowledging others feelings
  * Focus on shared passions
  * Create shared experiences
  * Repeat / distill what the other person said to communicate understanding

* Write your own Leadership User Manual to share with others to work more effectively together
  * What is one of your top values at work?
  * What is one thing people should know about working with you?
  * What is one of your top strengths at work?
  * What is an area of growth that you are focued on right now?
  * Who is one of your professional role models?
  * How would you like to recieve feedback?
  * What is one of your prouder moments at work?
* If a user manual is not used, you have to trial-and-error your way through what works and what doesn't which is a slow process; most people have a pretty good idea about themselves alredy so start from there to be more effective.
* Alternating 1-1s between coffee chats versus professional development / work
* Time committments (e.g. team hours) vs flexible working hours are opposing views; use user manuals to find those friction points before they create a bad work environemnt.
* User manuals are maps / hypothetical ideals to help find common ground and practical compromise.

* A big role of leaders is listening and repeating back to communicate clarity of understanding before jumping into solutions mode - make sure you are solving the right problem (if there is any problem to solve at all)

* Managers often move a the speed of business, but trust is built much more slowly. Use 1-1s and other opportunities to slow down and build effective working relationships.

* Emotional bank account
  * Can make both deposits and withdrawls
  * Deposits:
    * Give full attention
    * Follow through with committments
    * Investing in "5 minute favors"
    * Celebrating others
  * Withdrawals
    * Excluding others
    * Letting somebody down
    * Blaming others (attacking the person, not the problem)
    * Interrupting, ignoring, or excluding
* New hires start at 50% and every action adds or removes from this bank account
* Withdrawals are managers not keeping 1-1s, which communicates building trust is not a high priority.

* Trustworthiness = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-orientation
  * Credibility focuses on the words we speak
  * Reliability focuses on the actions we take
  * Intimacy focuses on how safe people feel
  * Self-orientation focuses on how much you benefit personally
* Example: Dominating a business meeting because you need something now has low trustworthiness

* Relationship Audit: A tool to calculate trustworthiness and then figure out desposits you can make to build that trust up.
