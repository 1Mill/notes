# Running highly effective performance reviews

LINK

## Key Takeaways

* Performance reviews should not be a suprise, they should be topics and themes regularly discuss during 1-1s or other more regular check-ins.

* When giving a review, spend 50% of the time giving a presentation talking about sengths, wins, improvements, and overall raitings and the other 50% having a conversation about the presentation. Make sure to be aware of how the information is landing. Regularly check in with the person about how they are feeling about this information.

* Always end performance reviews with a path forward. This doesn't have to happen immediately and can be done in a follow up meeting, 1-1, etc. But work together to create a plan for the future in terms of long term career growth, areas for improvement, and more. This plan can be directional (e.g. supportive) or instructional (e.g. directive) depending on how the person is looking to grow. Ultimiately though, as their manager, you are responsible for creating an environment where great work is inevitible.

## Notes

* As a manager, your role is to drive value from these performance reviews
* People should leave performance reviews empowered, with direction
* Identify where people need to grow to achieve their career goals

* Highlight where they shine, where they can improve to meet their career goals
* People might become defensive, emotional, etc. so need to know how to navigate those scenarios
* With a glowing review, people may expect a raise or a promotion which may not be doable at the moment; so learn how to manage expectations

* Performance reviews are two things:
  1. Presentation about the direct reports work, achievements, pitfalls
  2. Conversation about how to address or leverage the above to work towards their career goals

* To give an effective presentation you must be
  * Prepared
  * Structured
  * Know the data
  * Anticipate follow-up questions
  * Aware of type of tone you want to achieve

* To facilitate an effective conversation you must be
  * Approchable
  * Listening
  * Calm environment

* Strive to get direct reports invested in the performance review so they are more likely to follow up and follow through with goals set forward for them

* Performance reviews should feel like a formality because all of the above are being talked about and worked on regularly during 1-1s
* Regularly evaluate the data which performance reviews are based on during 1-1s
* Really understand the data and why it is important to the business

* How can we help employees leave the meeting feeling recognized and empowered?
* Format for effective performance reviews
  1. Quick check-in - gauge if people are mentally ready to have this conversation (3-5 minutes)
      * "How are you feeling today?"
      * "Is this still a good time to have our debrief?"
      * Frame the structure of the meeting by giving a high level overview
  2. Summarize strengths and wins (5-10 minutes)
      * "Based on your own observations, what were the top strenghts you exhibited this year?"
      * "Here's what I think you've been doing really well ..."
      * "The company values you live up to the most are ..."
  3. Summarize areas for improvement (5-10 minutes)
      * "Based on feedback you received this year, what do you think you could have done differently to be more effective?"
      * "What are the areas of growth that are most important for you to continue to be successful in your role?"
      * "Here are a few areas I'd like you to focus on improving for the next evaluation period ..."
      * Name the impact from strengths and give clear feedback around areas for improvement
  4. Present your overall raiting (5-10 minutes)
      * Maybe talk about salary or promotion if it makes sense - makes sure to manage expectations around this topic

* Ref: Situation, Behavior, Impact, Way forward (SBIW) feedback model
* 50% of the performance review should be asking for reactions
  * Ask for questions frequently or wiat until after the presentation at least during the conversation part
* Ask for reactions
  * "How did this feedback land?"
  * "What do you agree or disagree with?"
  * "What did I miss?"
  * "What emotions come up?"
  * "Do you agree with my summary?"
* Ask emontional question, get emontional responses

* If direct report appears suprised or disagrees
  * Ask for details from their perspective
  * Be prepared with own details
  * Focus on the future
* If directe report appears very emotional
  * Use active listening
  * Show empathy
  * Rescheudle if needed to give time to process information

* End performance review with discussing the path forward and asking "How does that sound?"
  * For missed expectations
    * "What do you think will help get you back on track next quarter, year, etc.?"
  * For met expecations
    * "What things do you think will help you do even better next quarter, year, etc.?"
  * Additional questions
    * "How do you plan on putting the feedback from this review into practice? How can I help?"
    * "Are there any actions which leverage your strength we should be doing more of?"
    * "Are there any activites you think you should be doing less of?"
    * "Going forward, what can I do better as a amanger to support you?"
