## Key Takeaways

* The GROW coaching model is broken into four steps: the Goal, the Reality, the Options, and the Way Forward. Use the GROW framework to focus coaching conversations. Dig deep into each step with the four probing questions: Open Questions, Story Questions, Hypothetical Questions, and Closed Questions.

* Coaching lives on a spectrum from Very directie to Very supportive. Where somebody falls on this list depends on their level of expertise in the area. Somebody may be an expert in one area needing a more supportive approach whereas junior in another were they may need very direct instructions.
