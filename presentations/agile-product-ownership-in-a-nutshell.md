# Agile Product Ownership in a Nutshell

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=502ILHjX9EE>

## Key Takeaways

* Product owners (POs) must have a vision for detailing
  1. Who the product is for
  1. Why the product is being build
  1. What the product will be solving for the who
* Teams have a finite capacity to discover and deliver - trying to match input with output ensures work flows smoothly.
* The most important job of a PO is to say "no" and own those consequences so that expecations can be properly managed with everybody.
* Use wisdom of the crowd to right-size ideas in terms of impact on customer outcomes and level of effort.
* Focus exclusively on how team outputs are driving important customer outcomes.
* Invest in technical debt at just the right level to ensure teams are able to flow at a consistent velocity.
* Value = knowleve value + customer value; sometimes it is better to learn an idea won't work as early as possible than to waste more time on it.

## Notes

* Product owners (POs) must have a vision for how the product which details (1) who the product is for, (2) what problem will be solved, and (3) why the product is being built.
* PO helps turn ideas into user stories.
* Shoving more stories onto a team is like shoving more paper into a printer: the job does not get done faster.
  * Teams have a limited / finite capacity.
* How to limit input
  * SCRUM limits story intake using past throughput / velocity - last week team released 5 stories so this week lets do 5 again
  * Kanban limits work in progress - we can only work on 5 stories at a time.
* Ideas are generated significantly faster than they can be implemented - creating a backlog.
* **The most important job of a PO is to decide what not to build and owning the consequences of that decision.**
* Use wisedom of the crowd to right-size ideas, like utility and effort to be able to compaire ideas
* Conversations are more important than accuracy when finding right-size.
* POs need to balance different types of risk
  * Business risk - are we building the right thing?
  * Social risk - can these people build it?
  * Technical risk - will it work and scale?
  * Opportunity risk - can we finish on time and within budget (e.g. money, time, effort, etc.)?
* When risk is high we focus on discovery - learning cheaply through experiments, prototypes, etc.
* Value = Knowledge value + Customer value
  * Examples:
    * We prototyped 5 different implementations and customers hated all of them so we are not moving forward with this idea.
    * We prototyped 5 different implementations, customers enjoyed 2 so we are going to implement one of them for all customers.
  * Early on, discovery what then needs to be delivered, if at all - this is knowledge value. Then, deliver - this is customer value.
* Balance fire fighting versus fire prevention.
* Balance building the right thing vs building the thing right vs building the thing fast
* A product is never done until it is turned off completely in production and removed from the codebase.
* Do not focus on deliverying outputs (e.g. deliver 5 stories per week) - focus on delivering outcomes (e.g. our delivered stories this week improved outcome X for our customers)
* Reduce scope to meet timebox constraints - it is easier to add time to a project later.
* "If you organization doesn't like truth and honesty it probably don't like agile"
* Development team must contiousely invest in maintaining the system / reducing technical debt to avoid long-term slowdowns.
  * Short cuts every once in a while usually work out - short cuts all usually cause problems long term and result in significant velocity reduction.
