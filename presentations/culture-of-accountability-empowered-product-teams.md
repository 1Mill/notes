# Building a Culture of Accountability for Empowered Product Teams

<https://www.producttalk.org/2023/03/culture-of-accountability-empowered-product-teams/>

## Key takeaways

* Empowered teams balance customer values with business outcomes inside the constraints established by company leaders.

* Peer team reviews are critical to keeping a team accountable. If something inside the team is dysfunctional, it is easier for a person external to the problem to recognize and alert the team to it.

* If a team is struggling to meet an outcome, it is easy to assume it is a performance issue. But more often than not it is a structural issue where the wrong outcome or measures are being used. This is a sign to re-think the constraints the team is working inside of.

* Frequent discovery demos that focus on what a team has learned helps facilitate peer team reviews.

* To achieve empowered teams, focus on small improvements.

## Notes

* Keeping empowered teams accountable is difficult
* Empowered teams are on a spectum
* Traditionally product teams are feature focused teams controlled by stakeholders.
  * Auntomous have the flexibility to figure out how to discover and deliver business outcomes stated by a stakeholder
  * Empowered teams are measured by their impact on customers and how that impacts the business but within the expecations of the organization.
* Leaders set strategic context and empowered teams deliver in a way that is consistent within that strategic context.
  * Product vision
  * Security strategy
  * Technology stacks
* Being empowered requires balancing customer value work with keeping the lights on which is on a spectrum day to day and quarter to quarter.

* Discovery Demos
  * What has the team learned lately to help advanced progress towards their outcome?
  * Every two weeks
  * Start with why, then what we learned, then what is next
  * Feel free to make it an open forum to get wider community feedback
  * Make sharing cross team / guild / whatever to get community feedback / input
  * If a team isn't making progress, you can catch it early from demos to learn how to change something
* Reference: Radical Focus
* It is common to conclude that a team not meeting their outcome is because of performance issues, however, it is usually something else
  * Don't blame the flower when it doesn't grow, blame the gardener
* Frequent sharing reduces blind spots by getting input from people not as close to the work being done

* Guiding principles to hold empowered teams accountable
  * Focus on team's belief versus finding the perfect outcome out of the gate
  * Ensure the team has psychological saftey, even when they are failing
  * Ensure people feel accountability to their missions, not their boss
  * Focus on substance over style - get to the meat of what is being learning

* When things are going wrong, people have a tendency to jump back into outputs: "when is X going to be delivered?"
* Work in incremental improvements, not being prefect or doing large changes all at once
