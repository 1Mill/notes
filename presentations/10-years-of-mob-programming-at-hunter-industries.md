# 10 Years of Mob Programming at Hunter Industries

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS0SQ3CqIi4>

## Key Takeaways

* Lean Coffee Q&A Format is a cool approach to the Q&A format since people get to vote on the questions they want to hear answers to rather than first-asked-first-answered like traditional Q&A sesions.

* Hunter industries is an early adopter of many noval agile practicies like mob programming, no estimates, learning hours, TDD, and others. However, this was not an overnight change. Mob programming and no estimates was a cycle of experimentaion and building trust with stakeholders. Though, eventually stakeholders saw the higher quality of the output which further engrained mob programming and these other agile practicies into Hunter's culture.

* Mob programming works best when everybody is in-person or remote: no hybrid sessions. Additionally, mobbing works best with a size of 4 to 5 people with the mandate that everybody is both contributing and learning. If somebody is not contributing or learning, Hunter lets people jump between mobs. Sometimes this means jumping to another project on a different team. This takes inspiration from the "Laws of 2 feet" from Open Spaces.

* Hunter differentiates between mobs and teams. A mob should only be composed of 4 to 5 people but a team can be composed of multiple mobs working towards the same outcomes. One example given was a team of 12 people which composed weekly into 3 mission driven mobs. This dynamic reteaming is very similar to FAST Agile or FLUID Scrum.

* Mobbing is not limited to just programming, but also emailing, asking for help / insight from a product owner, etc.: anything that a normal individual would do day-to-day in a traditional organization.

* Mobbing breaks down barriers so that asking for help or clarifiation is more normal and does not feel like you are inconvenience somebody else.

* Rough schedule for a mob at Hunter

| Time | Event |
|---|---|
| 9am | Mob + 10 minute break |
| 10am | Mob + 10 minute break |
| 11am | Mob + 10 minute break |
| 12pm | Lunch |
| 1pm | Mob + 10 minute break |
| 2pm | Mob + 10 minute break |
| 3pm | Mob + 10 minute break |
| 4pm | Learning hour |

## Notes

* <https://easyretro.io/>
* Affinity grouping: forming a group around a shared interest or commong goal
* Lean Coffee Q&A format is kind of cool - people get to vote on the questions they want to hear versus just first-come-first-answered
* Interactions with larger org and stakeholders
  * No estimates workshop but marketing and manufacturing is all about estimates
  * Mobbing produced higher quality outputs that stakeholders noticed, which got buy-in
  * Slow process of trust building - difficult at first
  * Quality of software improves given variety of people that work in the mob
  * Experiment to improve
  * Product owners have gotten more comfortable with no estimates
  * Need open and honest conversations
  * Mob meets with product owners on a daily basis - ensures alignment and progress updates
  * Work with PO on feature slicing to deploy incrementall
  * Over communication and alignment are key
  * Mobbing is cross-training
  * CICD pipeling flowing because PRs are real-time
  * Traditional orgs are more likely to give critial work to hero programmers to "crank it out", making juniors miss out on learning

* What events, cermeonies, etc.
  * 4 - 5 is a good mobbing number to let people come without losing to much context as meetings, etc. come up. In a pair, if 1 person has to leave the pair any decisions that are made are unknown to anybody else in the org.
  * People can swap to any project they want
    * Align passion with work to be done
    * If you are contributing but not learning it is recommended to swap
    * Rule: if you are on 1 project for more than 2 years you are required to switch to another project
  * Learning 1 hour at beginning or end of day and Friday afternoons
  * One team is 12 people composed of 3 mobs, every Monday people can jump between mobs to facilitate sharing tribal knowledge.
    * -> A slower version of FAST Agile, but faster than FLUID Scrum
    * Avoid hero programmering from being single source of information, force it to be spread around the team
  * Every month do a "celebration" for wins during that month
  * Mob Mentality Show is a podcast from Hunder Industries folks
  * Not heavy on documentation
    * Usually depend on tribal knowledge.
    * Usually depend on unit tests
  * No sprints or iterations
  * Do weekly retros - pick and choose scrum elements
  * Goal to automate everything as much as possible if doing it regularly
  * Do TDD or TAD (test after development) to prevent regressions

* Remote mobbing today and historical experience
  * Mobbing is very collaborative
  * Solo programming
    * When you have a problem it feels like are inturupting others.
  * One screen
  * Common lunch hour
  * Mobbing does not afford hybrid remote in-person groups
    * Everybody needs to be remote or in-person
  * Have a lot of meetings to check in on everybody since remote is more isolating
  * Remote is more isolating so you have very little insight into what other mobs are doing outside your own
    * It feels abnormal to interupt others to peek at what others are doing with a quick chat for example.
  * Mob programming is all about inviting others to come solve challenging business problems

* Do you mob program all the time?
  * Hunter is all in the same timezone currently - no insight into international mobbing
  * Do 7 hours a day + 1 hour learning time, friday 3 hour learning time
  * Every 45 minute take a 10 minute break
  * 1 hour lunch
  * Usually don't need overtime because overtime leads to burnout.
  * Philosophy: you should always be 5 minutes away from logging off to go hug your family
  * Do mob for more than just programming, will draft an email, message, etc. as a mob as well.
  * No one person should expect to be an expert in every technology that is out there, mobbing make asking for help less abnormal.

* Resources
  * List of companies out there that only do mob programming somewhere on Trello
