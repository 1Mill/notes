## Key Takeaways

* Every story, including those told using data, follows this structure
  1. Setup - The "before" state of the data
  2. Conflict - How the data changes; ask "What caused this change?"
  3. Resolution - The "after" state that the change leads to
* Distinguish each phase of your data-driven story with separate images and descriptive titles. Highly only the important information and leave everything else out.
