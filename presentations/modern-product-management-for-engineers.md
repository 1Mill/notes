# Moden Product Management For Engineers

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y-r7styha0>

## Key Takeaways

* Modern product management is the next phase of agile transformation. The Agile Manifesto focused on agile delivery (e.g. CICD, trunk based development, XP) from inside waterfall projects to make delivery quick, cheap, and frequent. Building on top of that, Lean Startups then focused on delivering the right feature through data-driven learning loops. Now, modern product management requires organizations to entrust ownership to product teams.

* Product teams are a tight knit group of people (i.e. tribe) with one role: product ownership. Product teams are autonomous and composed of engineers, designers, product managers, analytist, or any other role required to deliver end-to-end product value and business insights. Company leaders establish visions, whereas product teams establish and execute on strategies.

* One method to communicate how low-level tasks drive high-level business are Opportunity Solution Trees (OST). An OST is similar to a Discovery Tree (DT) in how to visually communicate work and start conversations to build alignment. However, a DT focuses on communicating the state of delivery work. Whereas an OST focuses on communicating the impact of experiments (e.g. features) on the larger organizational vision.

* To keep themselves grounded and clearly communicate their contribution to the organizatin's vision, a product team must have metrics. These metrics may be qualitative, quantitative, or a mix of both. But the most important take away is that these metrics must be meaningful and exist.

## Notes

* Currently a product team is defined as key stakeholders around a SCRUM Team. The SCRUM team is composed of a product owner, SCRUM master, and embeded Development Team.
* Agile was never ment to be static; we are uncovering better way of building software
* Evolution of agile
  1. Agile manifesto focuses on projects and how categories of people should work together (e.g. "business people"). Also focus on projects from Waterfall.
  2. Companies got really good at deliverying. Lean Startup's then focused on building the right thing.
      * Build, Measure, Learn feedback loop
  3. Metamphosis from project focus to product focus; focus on customer value
      * Long term committments
* Book: Inspired, Marty Cagan
  * SCRUM in many companies are just Waterfall under a different form: best manifested in lack of learning and ability to innovation.
  * 3 ways for product managers to work
    1. Backlog admin - managing tickets
    2. Roadmap admin - roadmap by stakeholder committee
    3. [Modern] Product manager - ?
* Torress
  * Leaders struggle to give up ownership of discovery
  * Teams are bad at estimating unpredicable work because it is unpredicable
  * Everybody outside of the SCRUM team continues to operate on traditional cycles like annual budgeting, quarterly reporting cycles, etc.
  * Teams expected to deliver on time and under budget - no time for learning or changing the roadmap.
  * Usability testing late in process
  * User research outsourced to agencies / external teams who do project based research - valuable context is lost through handoffs. Tribal knowledge immediately disappears.
  * KPIs focus on delivery (e.g. deliver X features this quarter), not customer or business value (e.g. north start metrics; team A owner product B generated $X.XX for the company).
  * If a feature was released and nobody used it, was it worth the cost?
  * Delivery becomes easy, the struggle to decide what to build became aparent.
* Cutler
  * Agile lost to by-the-book SCRUM
* Management as a middleman of communication is ineffective
* Modern PM
  * Requires product owners, engineers, and designers to work very closely together.
  * Everybody starting and finishing together around one product.
  * Projects are about outputs, products are about outcomes. We need to focus on products and outcomes: not outputs.
  * Outcomes are greater than roadmaps
  * Roadmaps communicate false sense of certainty
  * Customers are the end user; customers are king - even in B2B environments. Whomever is using the product is who you need to talk with to understand their goals.
  * There are two types work
    * Discovery work
      * Opportunities, bets - innovation
      * Talking to customers
      * Learning fast with expeirments, prototypes, etc.
    * Delivery work
      * Features - outputs
    * Individuals move between thinking and doing (blue work vs red work from Leadership is Language; dual track agile)
* Engineering teams do agile internally: researching and figuring what works and what does not from a delivery (e.g. CICD, infastructure as code) and technical (e.g. design patterns, service objects, microserivces, etc.), but often the reminder of the organization does not do agile and there are barries to entry when it comes to talking with customers.
* Most product owners outside of tech only have experience with delivery focused experience.
* Feature Factories - more feature will make us more money
  * Big emphasis on estimations for capacity planning
  * Work exists in a backlog, feed to the team - no opportunity for learning or changing when something new is discovered.
* Outcomes
  * Solve problems
  * Business results
* Outputs
  * Delivery of something (X number of features, x number of customer support calls, etc.)
* Being in a modern product team
  * Engineers no longer code monkeys
  * "Product, design, and engineering work side by side ... to come up with technology-powered solutions that customers love" - Cagan
* Discovery and delivery happen in parellel.
* Opportunity Solution Trees (look like Feature Mapping / Discovery Treeing / Discovery Mapping)
  * Visualize your thinking
  * Organize people around outcomes / business opportunities
* Book: Continous Discovery Habits
* Design, Engineering, and Product owners work closely together means taking to customers together
  * Talk to customers weekly to build empathy
* Experience Mapping / user journeys to understand customer friction points and gaps in your product
* Put engineers close to the customers - not telling them what to do through middlemen (e.g. managers)
* Use experiments to learn fast about what works versus what does not work for your team / organization
  * Need psychological saftey so that you can be critial and fail
* As an engineer, start asking why when assigned feature work
  * Why are we adding this feature?
  * What is the desired outcome?
  * What data do you have to support this hypothesis?
  * What metrics will we be measuring?
* Find customers to talk to
* FAST Agile
  * Give more auntonomy to product teams
  * Suggested breakdown of auntonomy

    | Area of Auntomoty | Role |
    |---|---|
    | Generate [long-term business outcome] | General manager (GM) |
    | Directly generate [short-term business outcome] | GM + Product manager (PM) |
    | Explore potential leverage point and run experiments to influence [specific business outcome] | GM + PM + Product Team (PT) |
    | Increase / decrease [metric] known to influence [specific business outcome] | TM + PM + PT |
    | Expore challanges or imporove experience for [segment of customers] | PM + PT |
    | Solve [open-ended customer problem] | PM + PT |
    | Build something that lets [segment of customers] complete [some task, activity, or goal] | PT |
    | Build something that does [specific behavior, input-output, or interaction] | PT |
    | Build exactly this [predetermined specification] | PT |

* Research: Allen Holub on software engineering
* SCRUM in practice / reality is focused on delivery - research happens else where, external to the team. Modern product management requires one team to do both delivery and discovery. As a consequence, the team is building valuable tribal knowledge about the context they are working in.
* Use metrics to support how delived work drove business outcomes.
* A demo to a stakeholder is a lot different than a demo to a customer.
  * Steakholders care about deliverables. Customers care about completing their task effectively.
* Test our assumptions through experiments supported by metrics - did feature X imporove outcome Y?
* Build tribal knowledge so that context is shared across the product team so that most members can meaningfully and independently make decisions that are aligned with the vision and/or mission of the team.
  * Every member has a different slice / perspective. Conversations bring those slices together to ensure the team is moving in the right direction.
* Scientists have always worked in discovery-delivery cycles
* How can a business prioritize experiments from an economic perspective? - Really no answer
  * Can measure what people use or not use / like or not like.
  * Everything is a bet - hopefully it is an informed bet with frequent check-ins. But what bets are taken versus not taken really depend on how the organization runs.
    * TEAL Orgs (similar to Open Source projects) prioritize based volunteerism
    * Waterfall Orgs traditionally prioritize on authority (or other status effects like legacy, HIPPO, etc.)
* You can measure how agile a team is based on how many experiments are output from a retrospective.
* Corporate SCRUM is the default for most "agile" companies
  * 2 week sprints on quarter planned road maps items
* "If you are doing the same agile that you were doing 6 months ago, then you aren't doing agile." - Fred George.
* Treat tasks, features, epics, etc. as a science expeirment.
  * Why are we picking this up?
  * What is our hypothesis? (e.g. metric X will increase because of reasons A, B, and C)
  * What evidence will support our hypothesis? (e.g. metric X increases)
  * How do we measure this?
  * If our hypothesis is terribly wrong (perhaps to the point of causing the business harm), what is our cutoff point or exit strategy?
* Retrospectives
  * Focus on team outcomes
  * Build and run experiments
* Experimentalism usually focuses on quantitative data, however, sometimes things are more qualitative.
  * Outputting more lines of codes does not mean a team is deliverying more value or more effectively than another team with less lines of code.
  * Metrics are important in telling a story, but the storyteller must be human (Book: Extreme Agility)
* Write an experiment down, else you are just messing around
* Psychological saftey is observed through equal speaking time in meetings, calls, etc.
  * Project Aristotle out of Google
  * Soft skills are more valuable than hard skills. Hire for soft skills; teach hard skills.
* Nothing (great) in humanity has been done in isolation - it has always been a collective effort.
* Historical agile has focused and worked for delivery, but now we need to learn how to do agile discovery
