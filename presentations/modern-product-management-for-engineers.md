## Key takeaways

## Notes

* Currently a product team is defined as key stakeholders around a SCRUM Team. The SCRUM team is composed of a product owner, SCRUM master, and embeded Development Team.
* Agile was never ment to be static; we are uncovering better way of building software
* Evolution of agile
  1. Agile manifesto focuses on projects and how categories of people should work together (e.g. "business people"). Also focus on projects from Waterfall.
  2. Companies go really good at deliverying. Lean Startup's then focused on building the right thing.
      * Build, Measure, Learn feedback loop
  3. Metamphosis from project focus to product focus; focus on customer value
      * Long term committments
* Book: Inspired, Marty Cagan
  * SCRUM in many companies are just Waterfall under a different form: best manifested in lack of learning and ability to innovation.
  * 3 ways for product managers to work
    1. Backlog admin - managing tickets
    2. Roadmap admin - roadmap by stakeholder committee
    3. [Modern] Product manager - ?
* Torress
  * Leaders struggle to give up ownership of discovery
  * Teams are bad at estimating unpredicable work
  * Everybody outside of the SCRUM team continues to operate on traditional cycles like annual budgeting.
  * Teams expected to deliver on time and under budget.
  * Usability testing late in process
  * User research outsourced to agencies / external teams who do project based research
  * KPIs focus on delivery (e.g. deliver X features this quarter), not customer or business value (e.g. north start metrics; team A owner product B generated $X.XX for the company).
  * If a feature was released and nobody used it, was it worth the cost?
  * Delivery become easy, deciding what to bulid became aparent.
* Cutler
  * Agile lost to SCRUM
* Management as a middleman of communication is ineffective
* Modern PM
  * Requires product owners, engineers, and designers to work very closely together.
  * Everybody starting and finishing together around one product.
  * Projects are about outputs, products are about outcomes. We need to focus on products and outcomes: not outputs.
  * Outcomes are greater than roadmaps
  * Roadmaps communicate false certainty
  * Customers are the end user; customers are king - even in B2B environments.
  * Two types of work
    * Discovery work
      * Opportunities, bets - innovation
      * Talking to customers
      * Learning fast with expeirments, prototypes, etc.
    * Delivery work
      * Features - outputs
    * Individuals move between thinking and doing (blue work vs red work; two track agile)
* We do agile delivery but the rest of the organization is not agile.
* Most product owners outside of tech only have experience with delivery focused experience.
* Feature Factories - more feature will make us more money
  * Big emphasis on estimations for capacity planning
  * Work exists in a backlog, feed to the team - no opportunity for learning
* Outcome
  * Solve problems
  * Business results
* Outputs
  * Delivery of something (X number of features, x number of customer support calls, etc.)
* Being in a modern product team
  * Engineers no longer code monkeys
  * "Product, design, and engineering work side by side ... to come up with technology-powered solutions that customers love" - Cagan
* Discovery and delivery happen in parellel.
* Opportunity Solution Trees (look like Feature Mapping / Discovery Treeing / Discovery Mapping)
  * Visualize your thinking
  * Organize people around outcomes / business opportunities
Book: Continous Discovery Habits
* Design, Engineering, and Product owners work closely together means taking to customers closely together
  * Talk to customers weekly to build empathy
* Experience Mapping to understand customer / user journeys
* Put engineers close to the customers - not telling them what to do through middlemen
* Use experiments to learn fast about what works versus what does not work for your team / organization
  * Need psychological saftey so that you can be critial and fail
* Start asking why?
  * Why are we adding this feature?
  * What is the desired outcome?
  * What data do you have to support this hypothesis?
  * What metrics will we be measuring?
* Find customers to talk to
* FAST Agile
  * Give more auntonomy to product teams
  * Suggested breakdown
    * Generate [long-term business outcome] - General manager (GM)
    * Directly generate [short-term business outcome] - GM + Project manager (PM)
    * Explore potential leverage point and run experiments to influence [specific business outcome] - GM + PM + Product Team (PT)
    * Increase / decrease [metric] known to inlfuence a specific business outcome - TM + PM + PT
    * Expore challanges or imporove experience for [segment of customers] - PM + PT
    * Solve [open-ended customer problem] - PM + PT
    * Build something that lets segment of customers complete [some task, activity, or goal] - PT
    * Build something that does [specific behavior, input-output, or interaction] - PT
    * Build exactly this [predetermined specification] - PT
* Research: Allen Holub on software engineering
* SCRUM in practice / reality is focused on delivery - research happens else where, external to the team. Modern product management requires one team to do both delivery and discovery.
  * Build tribal knowledge
* Use metrics to prove delived work drove business outcomes.
* A demo to a stakeholder is a lot different than a demo to a customer.
* Test our assumptions through experiments supported by metrics - did feature X imporove outcome Y?
* Build tribal knowledge so that context is shared across the product team so that most members can meaningfully and independently make decisions that are aligned with the vision and/or mission of the team.
* Scientists have always worked in discovery-delivery cycles
* How can a business prioritize experiments from an economic perspective? - Really no answer
  * Can measure what people use or not use / like or not like.
  * Everything is a bet - hopefully it is an informed bet with frequent check-ins.
* You can tell how agile a team is based on how many changes are experient with from a retrospective.
* Corporate SCRUM is the default for most "agile" companies
* "If you are doing the same agile that you were doing 6 months ago, then you aren't doing agile." - Fred George.
* Treat tasks, features, epics, etc. as a scneince expeirment.
  * Why are we picking this up?
  * What is our hypothesis? (e.g. metric X will increase because of reasons A, B, and C)
  * What evidence will support our hypothesis? (e.g. metric X increases)
  * How do we measure this?
  * If our hypothesis is wrong, what is our cutoff point?
* Retrospectives
  * Focus on team outcomes
  * Build experiments
* Experimentalism usually focuses on quantitative data, however, sometimes things are more qualitative.
  * Outputting more lines of codes does not mean a team is deliverying effectively
* Write an experiment down, else you are just messing around
* Psychological saftey is observed through equal speaking time.
  * Project Aristotle out of Google
  * Soft skills are more valuable than hard skills
* Nothing in humanity has been done in isolation - it has always been a collective effort.
* Historical agile has focused and worked for delivery, but now we need to learn how to do agile discovery
