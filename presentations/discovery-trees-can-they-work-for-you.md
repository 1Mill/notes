## Key takeaways

## Notes

* "DTs are very dynamic"
* DTs embrace discovery (i.e. learning) and change
* Just in time planning - the minimum amount of planning to get something done
* Business traditionally really likes estimates / certainty
* Plans are useless, planning is indispensable - paragraphing Eisenhower
* Problems: how we track, visualize, and estimate work?
  * People are remote
  * Physical boards make it difficult to reference / link directly to external sources
  * Communicate knowns and unknowns
  * Padding in estimates to account for unknown-unknowns
* History
  * Emerged from FAST Agile - <https://www.fastagile.io/>
  * Quinn Gil article on feature trees - <https://quinngil.com/2020/02/03/feature-mapping/>
* "Agile has given us tools to get really good at software delivery. We now need better dynamic ways to get good at discovery." - Ron Q.
* "[DTs are] the simplest/easiest way that I have yet discovered to visualize work (and give estimates) without doing all Agile PLanning Theater." - Steve K.
  * How much customer value is there in estimations? - Steve K.
* DTs are a collection of cards that visually communicate work and its state (to do, in progress, done, blcoked, etc.)
* Card colors
  * Blue - theme of this frame
  * Yellow - to do
  * Pink - in progress
  * Oranage - blocked
  * Green - done
  * Black - parking lot item
* Online, DTs can house other information outside of just the work to be done
  * References / links
  * Reminders
  * Notes
* Start working only when you have enough information to start working.
* As you progress through the tree, update the tree to facilitate communication
* Blocked communicates to stakeholders about external factors they need to help with - easy to see on the board
* "Embrace the chaos of knowing what you know now and not knowing what we don't know" - Steve K.
* Don't task out lower priority / future tasks - don't spent time on something you don't know if you will even do
* "Maximize the amount of planning NOT done" - Steve K.
  * It is clear when something is "done". What most people want is getting something in front of the customer and when that date will be.
* Limit work in progress (WIP)
* Get things in front of customers to start getting feedback
* Emergent design / evolutionary architecture - responding to real (code) signals to deliver
* Always append to DTs - never rewrite old stuff.
* Reference for Monte Carlo estimations: <https://www.focusedobjective.com/pages/free-spreadsheets-and-tools>
* If estimates are too high, cut scope - focus on feature slicing. Monte Carlo forecasts help information and visualize this conversations with confidence intervals.
* Updates estimates on a weekly basis to inform scope cutting
* DTs help communicate where the trouble spots are
* Ask every week: "Can we put this in front of a customer?" - Steve K.
* DTs are not
  * Total chaos
  * Anti-planning
  * Anti-architecture
  * Anti-estimates
* Entry experiments to introduce them to teamsa
  * Bug fixes
  * Refactoring code
  * Technical debt
  * Small new features
* DTs are all about visiblity that everybody (engineers, product owners, etc.) can look at
* Limit WIP, Discipline - only focus on the most important stuff at a given time
* Can help with data based forecasting

* DTs versus Opportunity Solution Trees (OSTs)
  * Many emergeing solutions are finding visual trees helpful for organizing people and communicating work and how it relates to the bigger picture.
  * DTS organize people around outputs; OST organize people around outcomes to inform what they should output.
  * Helps bring down walls between traditionally siloed groups. Get engineers insight into how work impacts outcomes.
  * DTs encourage feature slicing
* Weekly status report are useful for people that are not involved day-to-day in the Discovery Tree.
  * They seem like office hours for stakeholders or other teams that are removed from the team itself.
* Monte Caro simulations
  * Use "done" cards to inform how much work was completed each week to inform the next Monte Carlo estimation. Use historical week-by-week examples to output an average team velocity.
  * Constraints are important to help focus teams (e.g. WIP limites). Timeboxes are another example and Monte Carlo simulations help teams communication when the given timebox might not be right so that scope can be cut instead of teams crunching to meet the timebox - encouraging feature slicing.
