## Key Takeaways

* The Art of Action is a way to execute strategy in a fast moving and uncertain environment. It requires people to have clear task competency, clear areas of accountability, processes which do not constrain too much, and autonomy. These traits let people work collectively toward common goals but react appropriately to change. This change can come from the market, discovery, or anywhere. But the most important thing is that people have the freedom to act and act in a way which is consistent with the mission of the org.

* People must be able to think in both the big and small picture to be agile. A rule of thumb is to always be thinking about your boss's boss's strategy. This alignment will provide focus and guardrails to influence decentrallized and and autonomous decision making.

## Notes

* Agile teams moving fast still need direction
* The Art of Action is a way to execute strategy in a fast moving and uncertain environment.
* Alignment provides focus and clarity around a mission and autonomy to make decision making decentralized and quick.
* Pre-conditions for The Art of Action:
  1. People with task competence
  2. Clear structure to identify areas of accountability
  3. Processes which don't constrain too much
* Give people rigorous training in leadership skills and building domain knowledge.
* If you can't assign accountability, you don't know who contributed to the whole.
* If processes are too burdensome they will constrain capability too much to the point that the action that is taken will be too little of meaningful impact.

* To gain clarity of intent, you need a leader who is quite conceptual and has mastered the details of the business which is rare.
* They must also have self-confidence to take appropriate risks and tolerate ambiguity, not control freaks who must know everything.
* People who are can coach people in an incremental and appropriate manner to help them level up.
* A leader must be
  * Conceptional and master ambiguity as well as detail
  * Comfortable with delegation
  * Comfortable with coaching and developing people

* OKRs are an alignment technique
* Leading through intent is a task with a purpose, where the puropse is more important than the task
* Try to always think two levels above your current rank in the organization.
* If you understand the purpose and the context you are working in changes, you can easily change your task. If you don't understand the purpose or the context, you may be working on worthless stuff.
  * You don't need a review process to double check you are doing the right thing if you understand purpose and context.
* You must be focused - everybody must know what the single most important thing is.
  * "So tell me what you want, what you really, really want" - Spice Girls
* ORKs aren't really better than Spice Girls.

* The Art of Action is a leadership model and is holistic.
