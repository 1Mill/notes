# Product Managers and Product Owners: What's the Difference?

## Key takeaways

* There are two different types of product development teams: missionary and mercenary teams. Mercenary teams intake requriements from business stakeholders and output deliverables. A litmut test for mercenary teams are hand offs and/or a need to get sign off (particularly on deviations). A missionary team on the other hand does both discovery and delivery work (red and blue work from Leadership is Language). This builds tribal knowledge around the business, customer, and technology context of the work to be done. Traits which afford autonomous bottom-up decision making.

* A team under the continuous discovery product management style is composed of 3 main parts: deliverers, a product ensemble, and customers. Deliverers deliver outputs needed to sustain an end-to-end delivery cycle. Colloquially this means deliverers work together to design, code, release, and measure the value of features that make up a product. A product ensamble (e.g. product trio) is a group of deliverers who have individual capacity and passion to discover what next to work on. This is done through conversations with customers to understand their goals and pain points. The last group: customers; are defined as the human using the team's product.

* The product ensamble should output artifacts from Opportunity Solutions Trees, Customer Journey Maps, and other tools to communicate the customer, buisness, and technology context the team is working in. This keeps the discovery process transparent, fosters alignment, and provides a guide for whenever a decision must be made.

## Notes

* Traditional Product Management
  * Sits in the middle between buisness stakeholders and engineering team
  * Turn business decision into requirements document handed to engineering team
    * The waterfall method (old way of working)
  * Mercenary teams versus missionary teams of engineers
    * Mercenary team
      * Told to build something specific, build only that thing
    * Missionary team
      * Tasked with mission - an objective trying to be reached
      * Members willing join team/mission indicating buy-in which results in higher quality software
        * Aligns passion with work to be done.
    * Every business wants high quality software, so they try to strive for missionary teams.
    * Traditional business model encourages mercenary teams because work to be done is defined top-down not bottom-up (i.e. no auntomony).
    * Mercenary's just build what they are told, even if they know it isn't going to be good because they are so far removed from the decision making.
  * SCRUM model
    * Tries to solve some of the mercenary problem
    * Product owner still build requirements but from customers (not business folks) in smaller iterations
    * Try to work in faster iterations than waterfall
    * Customers or product manager are not experts on what is possible with technology so teams are still mercenaries because engineers are removed from the decision making process still.
  * Project based discovery
    * Replace product owner with Product Trio to co-create requirements gathered from customers
    * Product Trio composed of a product manager, designer, and engineer
    * Handoff still exists
    * Most engineers still removed from the discovery / decision making process, but at least have some representation / their perspective included.
    * Product Trio can move really really fast whereas engineering becomes the bottle neck with lots of backlogged items output from the Product Trio (e.g. epics, features)
    * If a bottle neck emerges, then organizations start to think about seperating these roles into isolated discovery and delivery teams.
      * This is an anti-pattern straight back to waterfall with handoffs and backlogs all over the place.
      * Want to bring engineering team closer to discovery: not further away.
      * If discovery is slow: multiple discovery teams with one delivery team
      * If delivery is slow: one discovery team with multiple delivery teams (most common pattern)
        * Product manager gets pulled several different directions juggling all the daily and weekly SCRUM events across all the different delivery teams.
        * It is common to want to add a product owner (i.e. product manager assistant) between the Product Trio and the Engineering team to proxy in daily and weekly SCRUM events. But this is another anit-pattern where now the product owner is acting as a middle man between the Product Trio and the Engineering team, just like Business Stakeholders and the Engineering team in waterfall.
          * Product owner is also not working with customers to build requriements, so really they just become a Backlog Admin which results in high turn over.
        * A hand off is a red flag to know if you are on a mercenary or missionary team
* Emerging Continuous Discovery pattern
  * Product Trio co-creating with customers still
  * Engineering team memebers individually join Product Trio in opt-in/opt-out (law of two feet) when (a) very passionate about a topic and/or (b) have slack in the delivery work.
    * This becomes a self regulating system if innitiative is balanced with good judgement. If people are busy, they won't uptake new work. If people are not busy and passionate then will discover something new. If people are not busy and not passionate, ... that is a different topic.
  * Use Opportunity Solution Trees, Customer Journey Maps, and other artifacts to communicate discovery work to engineers who could not particpate in Product Trio
    * Communicate why we want to build this new feature - build alignment across the team
    * Communicate the context / learning from the Product Trio so that engineers (or other team members) can make autonomous decisions that are aligned with the mission.
* Most "agile" organizations have one foot in waterfall and one foot in customer discovery.
