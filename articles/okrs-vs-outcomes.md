# Ask Teresa: Whatâ€™s the Difference Between OKRs and Outcomes?

<https://www.producttalk.org/2023/03/okrs-vs-outcomes/>

## Key takeaways

* OKRs are an aspirational qualitative goal with quantitative key results. An example is a person wanting to be healthier their measurable key results might be something like going to the gym 3 times a weak, having salads for lunch 3 times a week, and so forth.

* An Outcome is an aspirational qualitative goal which can be represented in an OKR format.

* There are two types of outcomes: business outcomes and product outcomes. Business outcomes relate to the health of the business, like being profitable. This may translate into an OKR with a key result of $X MMR. Alternatively, product outcomes relate to customer behavior in a way that more customer value is produced. For example, an e-commerce website may have an outcome to make their checkout process as smooth as possible. Product outcomes indirectly impact to business outcomes. Building on our example, making the checkout process smooth may have a side effect of selling more items and as a result increase MMR.

## Notes

* An OKR is an aspirational qualitative statement with quantitative results.
* An Outcome is the impact of an action.
* Start with outcomes, then define actions.
* An outcome may be expressed as an OKR.
* Business outcomes and product outcomes are not the same thing.
* "Business outcomes measure the health of the business. Product outcomes measure a change in customer behavior."
* Product outcomes indirectly, not directly, impact buisness metrics.
* All product outcomes should measure some sort of customer behavior.
* "OKRs Are a Way to Express an Outcome"
