# The Misapplied and Misunderstood: Two-pizza team rule

<https://polarsquad.com/blog/missapplied-and-misunderstood-2pt-rule>

## Key Takeaways

* Many organizations implement 2PTs structurally but not culturally. 2PTs must be autonomous and capable of delivering value end-to-end from ideation to delivery and support. Many organizations instead implement 2PTs along functional lines: grouping engineers into one team, designers into another, sales into another, etc. This creates dependencies between 2PTs which errodes both autonomy and capability. Furthermore, functional 2PTs are incapable of delivering end-to-end value, so some external layer above functional 2PTs dictate and orchestrate across functional 2PTs what is and isn't valuable to work on.

## Notes

* The optimal team size is very subjective and context dependent.
  * Need design?
  * Need accounting?
  * Need security?
  * Need infastructure?
  * Need third-party integration?
  * Need ... ?

* Two pizza teams often focus on utilization ("... enough work for everybody ...") instead of outcomes.

* Two pizza teams should be able to deliver value end-to-end from ideation to delivery.
* Two pizza teams are often only structured around delivery and ideation is left up external to the team (i.e. mercenary teams instead of missionary teams).
* "Without autonomy, the productivity goals of 2PT evaporate."
* Two-pizza teams (2PT) must be accountable and autonomous.
* At Amazon, 2PT are given a single business metric to improve.
