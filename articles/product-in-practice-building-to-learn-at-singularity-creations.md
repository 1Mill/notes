# Product in Practice: Building to Learn at Singularity Creations

<https://www.producttalk.org/2023/01/singularity-creations/>

## Key takeaways

* Opportunity Solution Trees (OSTs) make saying "no" easier. OSTs create a visual narrative about the organization's mission so that ideas can be juxtaposed. If an idea dosn't align with the org's mission, is more costly than alternatives, or other factors, it is easy to say "no" to remain focused.

* Make learning cheap by building just enough. Once something is out there, look at how customers are using it. Use recorded sessions, analytics, interviews, or any other methods. If there is value there, then iterate agian in another tiny step. Do no overbuild or over engineer by answering the question "How do we know that we have to build this?". Embrace emergent design by reacting only to real signals.

## Notes

* Saying "no" to ideas is a major factor of product management / development so that you can focus what on what most valuable right now.
* Opportunity Solution Trees (OSTs) help visualize your thinking and communicate how requests/ideas fit (or do not fit) into your current objectives.
* Lots of feature ideas are "hypothetically relevant features until they ran out of steam because they couldn’t increase adoption"
  * How much time, effort, resources, etc. do we waste on unvalidated ideas? Make learning (i.e. being wrong) cheap!
* Customers think they know what they want and tell you. But that does not always align with your business outcomes.
* We need to compare and contrast ideas in a structured way to know where to put our effort for maximal returns
* "Instead of tackling one big problem with one big solution" break opportunities into small chunks which can be quickly and cheaply validated.
* Helena wanted a nudge feature, so instead of going overboard and creating a whole messaging system she strictly made a nudge system with (1) a text input that (2) sends as an email. No nudge history, no reply back, etc.: just fire and forget.
  * Simple, cheap, and not over engineered to learn if this drove customer value
* Observing customer behavior through session recordings or other analytics is innavluable to understand how they are interacting with your features.
* After enough customer feedback / validating the idea, Helena and the engineering team opted to build a full messaging system with history, real time in-app chats, etc.
* Building in iterative chunks helps software solutions emerge rather than having to guess upfront.
  * Build only what you need today. Tomorrow will figure itself out.
* Validating iterations builds buy in. If a customer is using a feature it makes sense to invest in making that feature better. If a feature is not being used, you can cut your losses early.
* "With the discovery process as Teresa has set it up, there’s a narrative, a structure, and a logic. And you can use that to build a story to tell."
* One big decision to build one big feature is a bigger cost than making 100 small decisions to build 100 tiny and scrappy features.
  * Type 1 versus Type 2 decisions - make learning cheap
* "Learning to build just enough is a skill" which can be answered by "How do we know that we have to build this?"
* "Whatever process you use will give you the result. So if you don’t like the result—or the product—you should look at the process."
