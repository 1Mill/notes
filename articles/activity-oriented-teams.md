## Key Takeaways

* Activity-Orientated (AO) Teams are mono-functional teams which drive profitiability through efficiency. AO Teams focus on maximizing utilization which means working from large queues or large batches. AO teams are mono-functional so they collaborate with other teams on a temporary project-by-project basis to deliver end-to-end value. AO teams strive to enforce team efficiencies which means streamlining hand offs and maximizing velocity. However, each AO teams optimizes for itself and has a little slice of the big picture. Therefore, business and customer outcomes are often left with gaps. Alternatively, Outcome-Orientated teams are better structured for product development.

## Notes

* Outcome-orientated (OO) teams are often better structured for product development then activity orientated (AO) teams.
* AO teams are often mono-functional and are tapped by other teams on a temporary basis to employ their expertise.

* AO teams are ideal when a team wants to employ cookie-cutter agile scaling where Pizza Sized AO teams are plug-and-play anywhere within the organization.
* AO teams help with standardization since all AO teams report to an AO department - guilds are often less formal.
* AO teams strive to maximize utilization of each team member and velocity - innovations that drive efficiency are what drive profitability.
  * For OO teams, innovation that drives monetizable customer outcomes is what drives profitability.

* Product management AO teams are often reponsible for defining the spec / requirements from some other external depenency.
* AO teams often focus for their narrow mono-functional focus and not the bigger picture at large. This encourages big-batch hand-offs because it makes more sense for a testing team to test a whole release at once then test a single new capability every once in a while to maximize the testing teams utilization.
  * For OO teams, sometimes doing nothing is more productive in the long run then trying to multi-task.
* "Specialization isn't the problem; organizing along lines of specialization is."

* AO teams maximize utilization at the expense of outcomes.
* Reponsiveness to the market is often more valuable for product develpoment than efficiency.
