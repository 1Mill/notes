## Key Takeaways

* Outcome-orientated teams are long-lived missionary teams who is capable of delivering working software from ideation to delivery around some particular outcome the company cares about. Outcome-orientated teams must be able to make autooumous decisions and minimize external dependencies. This often means being cross-functional with many domain experts. This is different from activity-orientated teams which are often mono-functional and provide the company with some internal capability usable by other teams. A common exmaple of an activity-orientated team is a design team working with an engineering and data team managed by a product owner to manage collaboration.

## Notes

* Stakeholders often don't care about activity metrics: they care about outcomes. Things like improving usability, increasing profitability, making the product more marketable / competitive. They don't care about metrics like cycle time except as a proxy to some outcome.

* Solving outcomes means realizing / innovating across the entire product lifecycle: not just the scope-delivery process.

* Outcome-orientated teams are cross-functional and independent (e.g. no external dependencies) whereas activity-orientated teams are mono-functional (e.g. design, security, data).
* Mono-functional teams must work with other Mono-functional teams to deliver end-to-end customer value because no one mono-functional team has the capability to innovate across the entire product lifecycle: only within the one functional area.

* A benefit of activity-orientated teams is junior have a change to work with seniors in the same skill set. In outcome-orientated teams this may not be the case. For example, a design may be the only design on the team of 8 engineers. To mitigate this, create activity-orientated guilds.

* Outcome-orientated teams shine when funded by a non-project based funding models. Project based funding models encourage temporary mercenary teams whereas outcome-orientated teams should be long-lived missionary teams (or at least for as long as the outcome is relevant to the business).
* Project based funding often leads to instability in management, reporting, and funding structures.
