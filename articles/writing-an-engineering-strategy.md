## Notes

Defining a stratagy

* Book: Good Strategy, Bad Strategy
* A stratagy is composed of 3 parts:
  * Diagnosis: identify root causes / challanges.
  * Guiding policies: rules to handle challanges, usually with implicit or explicit tradeoffs
    * Policies should be opinionated
    * "If a guiding policy doesn’t imply a tradeoff, you should be suspicious of it (e.g. “working harder to get it done” isn’t really a guiding policy)"
  * Coherent actions: concrete actions to address challanges.
    * "... a strategy is only meaningful if it leads to aligned action"
* Most writen policies are actually aspirational vision statements: not concrete solutions to handing real challanges that are impacting people today.
* "To write an engineering strategy, write five design documents, and pull the similarities out. That’s your engineering strategy. To write an engineering vision, write five engineering strategies, and forecast their implications two years into the future. That’s your engineering vision."
* Consensus is what enforces strategy if you do not have authority - if people are not bought in then nothing will change.
* As an exeutive with authority
  * Write the strategy yourself, do not delegate this because it has huge long term implications for the organization
  * Build buy-in / consensus from other executives and influence within the company that are not executives.
  * Identify a list of all stakeholders and create a sub-set of 3 to 5 people to get rapid feedback from. Do not include the CEO because they hired you for a reason.
  * Create a diagnosis section - trust your gut about what is being said formally and informally throughout the company. But get feedback to validate your gut.
  * Write policies and get feedback from 2 to 3 external engineering executive at other companies.
  * Socialize the plan.
  * Work with working group to ident  * Write actions again getting feedback from the working group.
ify individuals that are likely to strongly disagree with the strategy - do 1-on-1s with these people. Do not compromise the strategy to accomidate their feelings.
  * Publish, present, and ask for feedback within 1 weeks worth of time.
  * Finalize the strategy and review in two months.
  * Update the strategy on an annual basis.

When to write a strategy

* Examples from Calm:
  * Choose boring technology
  * Resolve conflict with curisoity
  * Prefer vendors for commoditized functionality
* Strategy build alignment which makes decison making easier
* Questions to ask before getting started
  1. "Are you either confident in your diagnosis or do you trust the wider engineering organization to inform your diagnosis?"
  2. "Are you willing and able to enforce the strategy?"
  3. "Are you confident the strategy will create leverage?" - "... a year's worth of conviction ..."
* Wait to start formalizing a strategy in writing until you have confidnece in the 3 questions above.

Dealing with missing company strategies

* An engineering stratagy should complement and support other non-engineering stratagies - not a standalone thing. It needs to be writen in the context of the business.
* Work with peer executives to create a private draft of their stratagies to inform your engineering stratagy.
* Questions to answer
  * Cash-flow targets?
  * Invesment thesis (e.g. sales, research, admin)
  * Purpose of mergers? - What gap are they filling?
  * Inputs and outputs of work between teams
  * Ideal customer
  * What does success look like / metrics
  * Competative threats?
  * What is not working?

Structuring your guiding policies

* Questions to answer
  * "What is the organization’s resource allocation against its priorities? (And why these ones?)"
    * Make policies concret - 4 product engineers per 1 platform engineer
    * Make clearly explain exceptions
  * "What are the fundamental rules that all teams must abide by? (And why do they matter?)"
    * "... explicitly explaining why each rule is important" - even if they are obvious
    * Detail who can approve exceptions
  * "How are decisions made within engineering? (And why do we work this way?)"
    * Provide clarity and context about what decisions can and cannot be made autonomously
    * Provide a clear way to propose changes
