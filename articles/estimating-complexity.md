# Estimating Complexity

<https://lizkeogh.com/2013/07/21/estimating-complexity/>

## Key Takeaways

* People like predicatibility and forecasting, but this isn't possible when doing something novel.
* Use the estimating complexity scale mentioned below on user stories and internal process changes to know if the solution is COMPLEX, COMPLICATED, or CLEAR to build alignment, learn effectively, and more easily manage expecations.
* Always work on the highest risk must have things first to learn and make more informed decisions.
* Make every experiment safe to fail - which required ritual dissent to help think and migitate against the worst thinkable outcomes.

## Notes

### A Simple Way to Estimate Complexity

* People like estimations and predictability around projects, but saying "It's new. If you've never done it before, you have no idea how it will turn out." helps change the tone of the conversation.
* Urgent bugs must be done and so people don't care too much about estimations - but these are also usually short lived.
* Use Likert-like scale in estimating complexity -- mapped to [Cynefin domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework):
  5. Nobody in the world has ever done this before -- COMPLEX.
  4. Someone in the world did this, but not in our organization (and probably at a competitor) -- COMPLEX.
  3. Someone in our company has done this, or we have access to expertise -- COMPLICATED.
  2. Someone in our team knows how to do this -- COMPLICATED.
  1. We all know how to do this -- CLEAR.
* Measure complexity across multiple domains: people, technology, and process.

### Embracing Uncertainty

* Complexity estimates per business requirement in an epic help inform hidden complexity so that product owners can make informed decisions about scope and when something is ready to release - or worth doing at all.
* Always work on the highest risk must-have business requirement(s) first to learn early if something is feasible or not.
* Use comlexity estimates for process changes brought up during retrospectives to estimate how much of a known impact will be had on some desired outcome.
  * Encourages thinking that this change is an experiemnt with hopeful impact, but something that is reversible if we don't like it
* Address risk early and often (and ideally as cheaply or efficiently as popssible)

### Make Beter Estimates

* Engineers like to turn COMPLICATED ideas into COMPLEX ideas - do simple searches online (e.g. simple discovery) to know if the wheel has already been invented before diving straight into writing code.

### The Evil Hat

* Make every experiment safe to fail.
* Encourage ritual dissent to help plan for the worst case scenarios.

### Comments

* "In all honesty, once it's a 1, 2 or 3 then the expertise is retrievable and I donâ€™t worry about it. My focus with the estimation is entirely on finding and addressing complexity"
