## Key Takeaways

* Generative cultures are characterized by high-trust working environments which emphasize usable information. Usable information provides people with answers in a clear and timely fashion so the information is still relevant and actionable. In practice, this means having fast feedback loops, robust ways to share information, collaborative cross-discipline development, and clear communication styles.

* Writing code is a social art to communicate the hopes, dreams, and intent of code in a way which is understandable and approachable to others. But like any art, it must be intentionally practiced to get good at it. And while automated tools like linters may help with syntax, only feedback from other humans will help you learn how to express your hopes, dreams, and intent more cleanly in code.


## Notes

* Generative cultures are unique for how information flows throughout the orgnaization and usually not through tools like Jira.
* Generative cultures characterized by
  1. Fast feedback loops
  2. Robust information sharing
  3. Collaborative development
  4. Clear communication
* Bureaucratic cultures (the opposite of generative cultures) encourage siloed decision making where not all perspectives are considered or sought after perhaps for ego, political, or other reasons.
  * Examples would include HiPPO (highest paid person's opinion) and similar initialisms.
* "Good communication leads to more original ideas being shared ..."
  * Problems are spoted and fixed faster
  * Innovative ideas are not filtered out in the game of telephone up the chain of command
* “organizational culture that is high-trust and emphasizes information flow is predictive of software delivery performance and organizational performance in technology.” - Google
* Good information flow has three characteristics:
  * "It provides answers to the questions that the receiver needs answered"
  * "It is timely"
  * "It is presented in such a way that the receiver can use it effectively"
* Communication can be traditional like Slack or email, but more often it is how code is written so others can easily understand, extend, and use it.
* "Clean Code" is ...
  * "Kind Code" for all those who need to work with the code now and in the future.
  * Expresses intent using clear variable names, whitespace, and and punctuation.
* Code is ment for computers to run but humans to understand
* Code is a social art you must practice to be good at, and the only way to get better is through feedback from other humans.
  * Linters can check the syntax but not the intent of code.
