# Empowered Engineers FAQ

## Key Takeaways

* Feature focused product managers value writen lines of code over innovative potential. So, engineers are often excluded from the discovery process which inhibits their ability to contribute innovative technology solutions to customer problems. Instead, possible areas for innovation are filtered out through processes. Relegating engineeres only to delivery: never discovery.

* An engineer who appears to be solving the wrong problem likely lacks motivation or context. Conversations with customers helps build motivation whereas a strong mission and strategy provide context and constraints. Sometimes, however, solving hard technical problems which may seem like over engineer are the right course of action to improve customer outcomes. Examples are site relability to reduce downtime and improving CICD to deliver fasters and more reliable. But at the end of the day, conversations between people are the most powerful tool to building alignment and shared understanding.

## Notes

* Many companies prefer Product Managers with technology backgrounds.
* Engineers should participate in discovery work, such as customer interviews.
* A common complian from engineers is they are included to late in the cycle process - so they are just forced to deal. So, they do not feel empowered to contribute outside of just delivery work.
  * Often because people think writing code is more important
* "An empowered engineer depends on having a visceral understanding of the customerâ€™s pain."
* Over engineer is a symptom of no motivatin and/or no focus - a pitfall of the org, not the person.
  * Don't blame the flower for not growing in the dark room.
* Everybody needs to see the good, bad, and ugly - transparency is key to alignment and improving customer outcomes.
* Solving hard technical problems are sometimes the right thing to work on - such as improving the developer experience so everybody can be more productive (e.g. CICD, IaC).
* "...processes like SAFe are not used at true tech-powered companies that depend on innovation."
