# Amazon’s “two-pizza teams”: The ultimate divisional organization

<https://jasoncrawford.org/two-pizza-teams>

## Key Takeaways

* Two pizza teams (2PTs) are sizes of 6-10 people and fall into two different categories: functional or outcome-based. Functional 2PTs are responsible for expertise other teams can utilize. For example, a design team may help an engineering team with UX, or a security team may help a database team secure their infastructure. Functional 2PTs are inherently not autonomous and must work with other teams to deliver customer value. Outcome-based 2PTs on the other hand are give a single Profit-and-Loss (P&L) metric they are responsible for improving. Instead of being composed of a single role, Outcome-based 2PTs are compose of multiple roles to deliver autonomously without any external dependencies. This enables Outcome-based 2PTs to innovate to drive profitability, whereas Functional 2PTs hunt for efficiencies to drive profitability.

## Notes

* Two pizza teams (2PTs) are sizes of 6 - 10 peole, just enough that two pizzas should be able to feed the whole group.
* 2PTs can be structured in two ways: functional or divisional.
  * Functional is like the Apple model, where teams are formed out of a single functional capability such as a design team, a security team, a data team.
  * Divisional is like the Amazon model, where teams are formed around outcomes such as making a single key business metric improve.

* Most companies implement Functional 2PTs, whereas Amazon found success with Division or Outcome-based 2PTs.
* Functional 2PTs require external orchestration to manage the work of the teams wheras Outcome-based 2PTs are autonomous and health checks are performed to know if the team is improving its mandated outcome.

* A Division within an organization almost always has a Profit-and-Loss (P&L) report they produce regularly (e.g. quarterly checkins, annual reporting) which are outcome based.
* Outcome-based 2PTs drive this structure down to single 2PTs owning single metrics they must report P&L on.
  * This focuses the team on being profitable and increasing margins over doing the work more efficiently.
    * I should note efficiency can drive profitability, but this is only after economies of scale kick in which means whatever you are doing is a commodity and a race to the bottom is the only valid strategy unless you can do something else (e.g. increased quality increase profitability over competitors).
* In 2PTs, the team lead is the Divisional president / manager / CEO - they are responsible for the P&L metrics.
