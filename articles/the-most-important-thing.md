## Key Takeaways

* Engineers are often the most overlooked source of innovation within a company because they are thought to only write code: not have business insights. However, engineers work with the core enabling technology every day. Given a mission, context, guardrails, and autonomy, engineers can deliver innovative technology driven solutions because engineers know how technology can be leveraged in new ways others cannot.

## Notes

* Engineers are "the best single source for innovation" because they work with the core enabling technology every day.
* Engineers know what is technologically possible which others may not have considered before.

* Each level of an org provides focus to engineers
  * Product vision - attracts and inspired
  * Product strategy - working on most important problems
  * Team objectives - immediate problems to solve and outcomes to work towards
  * People
    * Product managers - provide business constraints
    * Design - provide UX constraints
    * Data - provide new insights

* Engineers need autonomy to deliver from writing code to architecture.

* "Empowerment of an engineer means that you provide the engineers with the problem to solve, and the strategic context, and they are able to leverage technology to figure out the best solution to the problem."

* "An easy way to tell whether you have empowered engineers or not, is if the first time your engineers see a product idea is at sprint planning, you are clearly a feature team, and your engineers are not empowered in any meaningful sense."

* Engineers are more than code monkeys and when treated as first-class members they have more liberty to innovate.
