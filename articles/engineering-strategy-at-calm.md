# "We're a product engineering company!" -- Engineering strategy at Calm

<https://lethain.com/calm-product-eng-company/>

## Key Takeaways

* As a leader, establish and communicate clear policies which drive the strategy forward. In most products, this means sticking with boring by reliable technology over bleeding edge. This way, engineers are focused mostly on product engineering over platform engineering because for most products the technology is a commodity rather than an competitive edge.

* As a leader, exceptions to policies you establish should be in writing and detail why the exception is permitted. Do not make it ambigious if the exception is given or not.

* As a leader, make sure you understand the business context you are working in and what your competitive edge is with customers. Then, adapt your strategy and concrete policies to that context.

## Notes

* Only adopt new technology because it enables new capabilities in the product which cannot be achieved through the current technology stack. This is because customer value is rarely influenced by the underlying technology. Most often, customer value is driven through product capabilities.
  * Be a laggard with technology.

* Keep everything in the monolith because it is easier to maintain than a microservice architecture.

* Get exceptions to any policy in writing and signed by the CTO - do not make it ambigious if an exception has been granted or not because this will scatter efforts. Focus is better and 70% solutions are better than all-or-nothing.

* Add clear guardrailes from a strategy perspective to keep teams focused on delivering profitable customer value over other considerations.

* Notice when teams are spending more time on platform over product work - means there is a misalignment in objectives most of the time (e.g. over thinking it, over engineering it, etc.)

* In most product spaces, technology is a commodity - so stick with boring technology, reliable, and well understood technology instead of starting with the bleeding edge.
