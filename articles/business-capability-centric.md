# Business Capability Centric

## Key Takeaways

* Business Capability Centric (BCC) teams are able to "think-it, build-it, run-it" with zero external dependencies. BCC teams are cross-functional outcome-orientated teams which drive profitability through innovation and responsiveness to the market rather than efficiency like activity-orientated teams. BCC should be supported through long-term capability funding models versus short-term project-based funding models. Long-term committments encourage long-term thinking so the product remains in a stable and clean state.

* There are two types of BCC teams: strategic and utility. Strategic teams hunt for new opportunities in the market to drive profits. Alternatively, utility teams are more focused within keeping the lights on to provide the company with some sort of well established capability (e.g. payment processing). Both the structure, funding, and mission of BCC teams derive from some heirarchy above. It is critical for this heirarchy to not let these teams go derelict as it will probably cause problems for the organization.

## Notes

* Business-capability centric teams (BCC teams) are able to "think-it, build-it, run-it" with no external dependencies.
* BCC teams are funded on stable capability-needed or long-term investment models, not temporary project based funding models.
  * This gives BCC teams time to learn and respond to the market to maintain product market fit over starting and restarting on a project based model.
* BCC teams must be outcome orientated and structured to realize their potential.
  * If a capability is misisng then this invites an opportunity for external dependency or low quality. An example is being a design missing from a team so engineers do the design work: this trade off may or may not make sense.
* BCC teams require careful curation from a higher authority.
  * This overhead is why I prefer self-organized models: responsible people know where they are needed.
* A single BCC team owning everything from the customer experience to API endpoints makes it easier to for each of these expeirences to stay in sync and decoupled from other teams which consume these resources.
  * Contract testing is critical!

* Project teams are mercenaries: "build-it, handover, disband".
  * Leads to issues with architecture / shortcuts
  * Leads to issues with support
  * Leads to issues with integrating with sunsetting systems because more effort to replace then just make it somebody else problem in the future
  * New idea, new team, little existing context.
* BCC teams are missonary teams: "think-it, build-it, run-it"
  * Long-term committment
  * House keeping

* Difference between strategic and utility BCC teams.
* Strategic teams are hunting for new opportunities in the market to drive profits.
* Utility teams are more focused at providing the company with some sort of capability, so are more focused about keeping the lights on.
