## Notes

* A heap is compose of 8kb sized pages in Postgres; each page contains a finite number of rows and a row is what it sounds like containing all the column values for that row. Hitting the heap is expensive because it is often done by doing a Sequential Scan (aka. Seq Scan) because without an index Postgres must search through each page to ensure it has all the results which march your query. To make this lookup faster, Postgres supports indexes which create a lookup like `id (row number, page number)`. For example, a value like `1234 (2, 3)` means that record with `id = 1234` can be found at row `2` of page `3` in the heap. This makes lookups much faster. But, to reduce IO (in/out) is where Covering Indexes to support Index Only Scans come into play.

* Postgres aggresively caches things, so use `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) ...` to see cache hits; also frequently change the query itself to try and avoid those cache hits when evaluating performance of indexes.

* With `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` always start from inside and work your way outside.

* The primary key (e.g. `id`) is not included in indexes by default in Postgres. If you intent to use the `id` be sure to `include` it.

* In a composite index, only sub-sets starting from the left can use the index; for example an index on columns `(a, b, c, d)` also indexes `(a)`, `(a, b)`, and `(a, b, c)`. But, it does not index `(b, c)`.

* `OR` statements cannot use indexes unless both sides of the `OR` are indexed - at which point the query planner will use a `BitmapOr` to find the relevant pages and then do a Heap recheck.

* Indexes are ordered and randomness within those indexes often causes shuffling in the index itself to balance the B-tree which results in frequent rewrite of the index - some use <https://www.npmjs.com/package/ulid> to get UUID-like identifers but sortable by time.
