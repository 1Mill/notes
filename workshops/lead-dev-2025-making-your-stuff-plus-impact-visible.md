#### Minto Pyramid reminders for stakeholder weekly summaries

1. Start with the bottom line (conclusion)
    * What is the key message or main status update you want stakeholders to know right now?
    * For example, 'The project is on track to meet the deadline because we have completed critical milestones ahead of schedule.'
2. Provide supporting key points
    * What are the 2-4 most important points that explain *why* the bottom line is true?
    * For example, 'Completed backend API integration, resolved major security vulnerabilities, user acceptance tests show 95% pass rate'
3. Add detailed supporting information
    * What specific evidence, data, or results support these key points? Include metrics, dates, or relevant context.
    * For example, 'API integreated by Sept 15, vulnerability fixes reduced CVEs from 8 to 2. UAT performed on Sept 20 by QA team with documented results.'

#### BLUF Reminders for stakeholder weekly summaries

1. Bottom line up front
    * What is the single most important update or outcome this week? State is clearly in 1-2 sentences at the very beginning.
    * For example, 'Project X is on track for delivery next week, after successfully resolving the API integration issues.'
2. Key supporting details
    * What are the main points that explore or support your bottom line? Limit yourself to 2-3 concise bullet points.
3. Action requests or needs
    * Do you need your manager's input or support on anything? State this clearly in a final short sentence of bullet.
    * Example, 'Would appriciate your help in prioritizing the deployment resources next week.'
